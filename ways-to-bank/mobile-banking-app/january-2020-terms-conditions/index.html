                <h4>App terms and conditions</h4>
<p>For the purpose of these terms and conditions, ‘app’ shall refer to both the Barclays app and the Barclaycard app. References to ‘Barclays Mobile Banking’ in any communications, your agreements, marketing material or other documentation shall mean the app.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Before you use the app</strong></p>
<p>These terms replace those we issued in November 2019 and reflect some new services that we’ll be making available now and in the near future. Please read and accept these terms and conditions to use the app. You can find out more on our app page https://www.barclays.co.uk/ways-to-bank/mobile-banking-app/archive-terms-conditions/.</p>
<p>To do certain things in the app, you might be asked to read and accept more terms and conditions that relate to what you’re trying to do – eg, if you apply for a savings account.</p>
<h5>Part A – Using the app</h5>
<p>About the app<br />
<strong>You can use the app to</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>View and manage all your Barclays accounts and related services in one place – including your current account, savings account, investment accounts, Barclaycard and mortgage if you have them</li>
<li>Make payments (including international payments) and move money between your bank accounts</li>
<li>Give us payment and other instructions on your bank account, including setting controls on your cards</li>
<li>Confirm your instructions with the mobile PINsentry in the app</li>
<li>Make contactless payments to merchants</li>
<li>Withdraw cash using Contactless Cash from a Barclays Self-Service Device</li>
<li>Open savings and investment accounts with us</li>
<li>Open a current account if you are an existing customer</li>
<li>Open a Travel Wallet, a feature that allows you to purchase and store selected foreign currencies, with the ability to spend them using your debit card (subject to the Travel Wallet terms and conditions)<br />
</li>
<li>Switch to a Barclays current account using the Current Account Switching Service if you are an existing Barclays current account holder</li>
<li>Become a Barclays customer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who can use the app?</strong></p>
<p>You must be aged 16 or over and have a Barclays current account, Barclaycard or savings account. If you're aged 11 to 15 years, you can use another version of the app</p>
<ul>
<li>It's only available for customers of</li>
<li>Barclays Bank UK PLC</li>
<li>Barclays Bank PLC in the United Kingdom, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man</li>
<li>Barclays Investment Solutions Limited</li>
</ul>
<p>If we need to, we can refuse to register you for the app and limit how you use it.</p>
<p><strong>The devices it works on</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, the app works on Android 5.0 or above and iOS 11 or later (we update these regularly). There are different features depending on your phone or tablet, operating system or version of the app you have.</p>
<p><strong>What does it cost?</strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're a personal customer, we won't charge you for using the app, although charges may apply on some international payments</li>
<li>If you're a business customer, we may charge you for certain transactions – depending on the tariff you've chosen. All our tariff information is available at http://www.barclays.co.uk/ImportantInformation/Ratesandcharges/P1242559944567</li>
<li>Your internet or network service provider may also charge you for using data on your smartphone or tablet</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to register</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you have a joint or business account, check with the other account holders that they’re happy for you to register for the app<br />
<strong>Step 2: </strong>You’ll need to download the app to your phone or tablet. Search for ‘Barclays’ or 'Barclaycard' in the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. Don’t download it from anywhere else<br />
<strong>Step 3: </strong>Read and accept the terms and conditions in the app<br />
<strong>Step 4: </strong>Once you've done this, register and match your mobile number with your Barclays current account or Barclaycard account. We use a third party to verify your mobile number with your mobile network operator. If you have authorised users on your Barclaycard account, only the main cardholder can register the account for the app</p>
<p>Conditions for using the app</p>
<p><strong>Using the app in the right way</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only use the app to view your bank accounts and related services, make payments, transfer money, give us instructions with the mobile PINsentry and view your PIN or withdraw cash from a Barclays Self-Service Device</li>
<li>Don’t use the app to upload or store inappropriate or illegal images or content that breaches the rights of others</li>

<li>Don’t use the app to do anything illegal</li>

<p>Information about you</p>
<p><strong>Keeping us informed</strong><br />
If your account details or any other information about you changes, tell us straight away.</p>
<p><strong>How you must protect your money and information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As of 13 January 2018 you can give your security details to authorised companies that require your security information to provide account information services (which allow you to see your accounts with different providers in one place) and payment initiation services (which allow an authorised third party to instruct us to make payments from your account on your behalf). When we say ‘authorised’ we mean a company that is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority or another European regulator to provide the relevant service. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority’s register (available at https://register.fca.org.uk/) will tell you whether a company is authorised. You should always consider the implications of sharing your security credentials and your personal information. If you suspect that anyone else knows them, call us immediately on 0800 400 100* (outside the UK dial +44 (0) 2476 842 099)</li>
<li>If you don’t let us know, we may not pay you back if someone takes money from your account because they knew your account details</li>
<li>The app gives you access to your bank accounts, so you need to make sure you don’t allow anyone to log into your account through the app</li>
<li>Always keep your phone or tablet secure and close the app if you’re not using it. Don’t let anyone see your PIN if you are viewing it on your app</li>
<li>App Push Notifications include your transaction details, which will appear on the locked screen of your mobile device unless you change its settings</li>
<li>Some devices allow you to use your fingerprint or Face ID for logging into the app. If you enable this feature, then anyone whose fingerprint or Face ID is registered on your phone or tablet may be able to log into the app and access your accounts. Therefore, you must not activate this feature if you allow other people to access your phone or tablet using their fingerprint or Face ID. You should delete any other fingerprints or Face ID registered on the device first; otherwise, transactions made by anyone else who has their fingerprint or Face ID registered on the device will be treated as being authorised by you</li>
<li>Don’t install or use the app on a jail-broken or rooted device. These have had their security features changed in order to work, which makes them less secure, and means that fraudsters could access your phone or tablet and steal your information or money</li>
<li>For security purposes, always use the latest version of the app.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If someone wants to know your security details</strong></p>
<p>We won’t ever phone you or send you an email asking for your security details. Nor will we ever ask anybody to do this for us. If anyone contacts you asking for your security details, they may be a fraudster. Tell us straight away on 0800 400 100 * (outside the UK dial +44 (0)2476 842 099).</p>
<p><strong>How we use cookies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app uses cookies and similar technologies when you first register, and to check that it’s you when you’re using the app. By using the app, you accept how and when we use cookies – as set out below</li>
<li>Cookies also help us improve how the app works. We use cookies to collect information about how you use the app, for example which areas you use most often and if you receive any error messages. We can then can make the app better and be sure that the products and services we offer are right for you and other people. We may also use the cookies to help us provide more meaningful and relevant communications to you and to see if our ads are working – for example, we can check if you downloaded our app in response to an ad</li>
<li>We need these cookies for the app to work – if you don’t want them, you’ll have to delete the app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the app accesses information about you</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you use certain features (like uploading content or the cash machine finder), the app will need to access information on your phone or tablet to work. You can limit this for some features, for example by turning off location settings on your phone or not using the features (like the cash machine finder)</li>
<li>If you enable push notifications in your device settings, we will send you notifications in accordance with the applicable OS (iOS/Android) End User Licence Agreement</li>
<li>If we can, we’ll ask you before the app accesses your device or information – and you can decline</li>
<li>You can manage how the app accesses your device or information using privacy settings on your iPhone or iPad, or by uninstalling the app (for Android). You can also do it through the usage settings in the app’s menu</li>
<li>If you don’t do this, we’ll assume you agree that the app can access your device or information</li>
<li>When you use any part of the app which needs your location to work, you agree that we (and other organisations that work with us) can collect and use information about your location</li>
</ul>
<p>What else you need to know</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the app and our terms and conditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we need to change anything about the app, we’ll tell you about the change in advance (if it negatively affects how you use the app) or we’ll tell you after we make the change (if it benefits you or doesn’t affect how you use the app). We’ll send you a text or alert or display a message about the change when you next use the app or log into our website. If there’s anything we need you to agree we might ask you to read and accept a message on your screen to continue using the app</li>
<li>From time to time, we may update the app through the App store. Depending on what the update is, you may not be able to use the app until you’ve installed the latest version and accepted the new information about it. We’ll let you know via your phone or tablet when there’s a new version to upload</li>
<li>Make sure any device you use to access the app complies with the standards and requirements we tell you about from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contacting you</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From time to time, we may contact you about the app by email, text or other messages on the app, or by telephone or post</li>
<li>Sometimes, these may be marketing messages. If you don’t want to receive them, you can tell us at any time by contacting us on our normal contact number. You can also text STOP in response to marketing text messages or follow any other instructions we include to unsubscribe</li>
<li>Statements – you agree to receive your monthly and annual Barclaycard statements in the app. These will be in PDF format. Statements are shown in the app for 12 months and can also be printed or saved on your own devices for future reference. They are also available in Barclaycard online servicing</li>
<li>Your digital statement may include notices that we are required to give you, such as arrears or default sum notices, and information about changes to your terms and conditions and interest rates</li>
<li>We may still sometimes send communications by post, for example, notices about a breach of your agreement. This may be instead of, or in addition to, communications by electronic means</li>
<li>It is important that you keep us updated with any changes to your contact details</li>
<li>Please remember that you are responsible for checking your statements whether or not you receive a statement reminder</li>
<li>Following a period of inactivity, we may remove your access to a digital servicing channel in order to protect your account information. If this happens, you simply need to re-register for access when you are ready</li>
<li>We recommend that you take copies of your digital statements if your account is closing for any reason, in case you need these for future reference</li>
<li>If you would prefer to receive statements by post, you can change your statement preference in Barclaycard online servicing or by calling customer services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If things go wrong</strong></p>
<p>If something goes wrong and it’s our fault, we’ll make good your loss. The terms of our account (the general terms or Barclaycard conditions) explain when you can claim back from us if you lose money because of something that’s our fault.</p>
<p>There are some things that we’re not responsible for because, for example, they’re out of our control or they relate to how your phone or tablet works. So we can’t be responsible if you lose money because</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't access the app for any reason or it’s slow</li>
<li>Any device, hardware or software you use with the app is damaged or corrupted or doesn’t work</li>
<li>The app doesn’t work as you expect, doesn’t meet your requirements or contains errors or defects or we don't correct these</li>
<li>You don’t receive a text or message in the app in time</li>
<li>We’re prevented from providing any service in part or in full because of something a third party does</li>
<li>A control applied to your Barclays debit card does not prevent a properly authorised payment, in the circumstances explained to you before you applied the control. For example, if you apply the Remote Purchase control then recurring transactions (such as subscriptions), instalments, refunds and in-store transactions will not be stopped, nor will transactions where a merchant incorrectly categorises a transaction or where the terminal does not dial out for authorisation (eg tickets on a train) – for further details see https://www.barclays.co.uk/current-accounts/debit-cards/card-management/ and the 'Cards' option under the 'Quick Links' menu on the homepage within the app</li>
<li>You do not update the app when prompted.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Part B – Paying a mobile contact</h5>
<p>You’ll need to read and accept these terms and conditions to send or receive mobile payments using the app.</p>
<p><strong>Pay a mobile contact</strong></p>
<p>The app lets you send money using just a mobile number, via a third party, either Pingit, Paym or other service we tell you about.</p>
<p>When you pay a mobile contact, the payment information they see will include your name, payment reference and the amount. Your phone number is not sent to the recipient.</p>
<p>You can also choose to receive payments by mobile. When you do this, anyone with your mobile number will be able to see your name and that you’ve registered to receive mobile payments.</p>
<p>Pingit and Paym let you link your mobile number with your bank account so you can send or receive money using a mobile. There’s more information on the Pingit and Paym websites.</p>
<p>Please note you can only register for Paym with one account. If you’ve already registered an account from another bank or building society, you’ll need to de-register before you can register with your Barclays account.</p>
<p><strong>Some things you need to know</strong></p>
<p>There’s no charge to make or receive mobile payments, but your mobile service provider might charge you for using data.</p>
<ul>
<li>The recipient will receive a notification and SMS to confirm the payment. They’ll also be able to see your name, payment reference, and payment amount</li>
<li>Payment limits apply – you can check these on our website (or in the app)</li>
<li>We might refuse to process a payment for reasons set out in the general terms</li>
<li>You need to tell us if you change your mobile number or account details so that we can continue to process payments correctly</li>
<li>The terms and conditions for using the app apply to this service, as do the general terms for your account</li>
<li>You must sign up for Siri Payments to use this feature in the app</li>
<li>You must have iOS 10 or higher on your device to use the Siri Payments feature</li>
<li>When using the Siri Payments feature you will still be required to use your fingerprint or Facial recognition to authenticate the payment, so you will need to ensure this functionality is activated on your device</li>
<li>You must have iOS 11 or higher on your device in order to use the Face ID feature</li>
</ul>
<p>If a payment is made by mistake</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to make sure you give us the right details so that we can ensure your payment goes to the right person</li>
<li>If you enter the wrong details, the payment might not go through or it might go to the wrong person. While we’re not held responsible for this, we’ll help you to try and get your money back. We explain this in more detail in the general terms</li>
<li>If someone pays you by mistake, you authorise us to take the money from your account and return it to them. You must tell us as soon as possible and return any money you suspect or know has been sent to you by mistake</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your information</strong></p>
<p>Barclays is committed to protecting your personal data. We will use your information for a number of different purposes, for example, to manage your account(s), to provide our products and services to you and others and to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. We may also share your information with our trusted 3rd parties for these purposes. For more detailed information on how and why we use your information, including the rights in relation to your personal data, and our legal grounds for using it, please go to one of the following</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.barclays.co.uk/important-information/control-your-data/</li>
</ul>
<p>or you can request a copy from us. When you choose to receive mobile payments, we share your mobile number with Pingit, Paym or other service we tell you about. This means other users of these services will be able to see your name and mobile number. You should also know that</p>
<ul>
<li>By selecting a contact within the app, you consent to Barclays accessing your address book</li>
<li>If you sync the app with your address book, we’ll store your contacts’ numbers on our servers so you can make payments quickly. We won’t use them for anything else</li>
<li>We don’t store any names, emails, addresses or other information from your address book</li>
<li>When you sync your address book, the app will show you who you can pay by mobile by displaying a Pingit icon next their name</li>
<li>If another user has your mobile number in their address book, they’ll be able to see if you’re registered to receive mobile payments</li>
<li>You can block our access to your contacts, but other Pingit users will still be able to see your name and that you can receive mobile payments, if you’ve registered to do so</li>
<li>When you use the Siri Payments feature, we will share limited data with Apple so that Siri can understand when you ask to make a payment, and can access payment details for the person you have asked to pay. Please see Apple’s privacy notice for details of how Apple uses your information. You can find the notice within your Siri device settings. You can opt out of Siri access within the app in your device settings at any time</li>
</ul>
<h4>Information we share with Paym</h4>
<p>When you choose to receive mobile payments using Paym, we will share your information with Paym and others. For more information, please go to one of the following<br />
</p>
<h5>Part C – Contactless Mobile and Contactless Cash</h5>
<p><strong>What is Contactless Mobile in the app?</strong></p>
<p>You can now make contactless payments of up to £300 using an NFC-enabled Android device. Contactless Mobile is currently only available to Android users with an NFC-enabled device running on Android 5.0 or above ('Eligible Device';).</p>
<p><strong>How does Contactless Mobile work?</strong></p>
<p>If you have an Eligible Device, you'll be shown an option to select Contactless Mobile in the app menu. If you have an eligible Barclays debit card and/or Barclaycard simply select the card you wish to pay with, select the app as the default ‘Tap and pay’ on your device and ensure the NFC functionality is switched on. While linked to the same account, your Contactless Mobile will have its own 16-digit number different to the one on your physical payment card. This Contactless Mobile account number can be viewed by selecting ‘account details’ from the Contactless Mobile homepage within the app.</p>
<p>If the payment is above £45 or you select ‘Always use PIN’ you’ll need to enter your normal card PIN into your eligible contactless device when prompted to do so whilst making a payment. Otherwise simply wake-up the eligible contactless device and hold it over the contactless reader.</p>
<p><strong>What is Contactless Cash in the app?</strong></p>
<p>Contactless Cash allows you to make contactless withdrawals of up to £300 per day from Barclays Self-Service Devices using an eligible Barclays debit card or eligible device.</p>
<p><strong>How does Contactless Cash work?</strong></p>
<p>If you have enabled Contactless Mobile on your device, you'll be presented with an option to select Contactless Cash in the Contactless Mobile feature of the app.</p>
<p>You can use Contactless Cash in the following ways</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply hold your eligible Barclays Debit Card over the contactless reader on the Barclays Self-Service Device and enter your normal card PIN when prompted</li>
<li>Make sure you have enabled the Contactless Cash feature on your eligible device and hold it over the reader on the Barclays Self-Service Device. Enter your normal card PIN when prompted</li>
<li>Enter the amount you would like to withdraw in the Contactless Cash feature in the app and when prompted, enter your card PIN into the app. After this is complete, hold the eligible device over the contactless reader on the Barclays Self-Service Device within the time limit displayed on the app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>
<p>If you want to return something bought using Contactless Mobile, you'll need your store receipt. It will show the last four digits of your Contactless Mobile account number, and it may be needed for the refund. When the merchant is ready to process the refund, you'll need to wake-up the Eligible Contactless Device and hold it over the contactless payment terminal. Refunds will also be subject to the merchant’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>TfL</strong></p>
<p>You can use Contactless Mobile to pay for your TfL journey by holding your eligible contactless device over the contactless pad at the TfL gate at the beginning and end of your journey. You won't be asked for your PIN even if you have switched on ‘Always use PIN’. The app will only present a screen with information and/or instructions if there is an error.</p>
<h4>What does it cost?</h4>
<p>There are no additional charges for using Contactless Mobile or Contactless Cash, but your internet or network service provider might charge you for using data on your eligible contactless device.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>What else do you need to know?</strong></p>
<p>You can continue to make payments with Contactless Mobile and withdrawals with Contactless Cash without a mobile network connection.</p>
<p>The app may ask you to log in after you have completed a number of consecutive transactions without logging in.</p>
<p>The app will need to access information on your phone or tablet to work. Additionally we collect location data for fraud prevention purposes. You can choose not to allow this information to be collected by turning off location settings on your phone. You can manage how the app accesses your device or information using your privacy settings or by uninstalling the app.</p>
<p>You will also be subject to your general app terms and conditions, so please read these carefully. These can be viewed via the Quick Links menu on the homepage within the app.</p>
<h5>Part D – Mobile Cheque Imaging Deposit</h5>
<p><strong>What is Mobile Cheque Imaging Deposit?</strong></p>
<p>You can now use mobile cheque imaging to deposit cheques securely using the app.</p>
<p><strong>How does mobile cheque imaging work?</strong></p>
<p>By scanning and submitting cheques drawn on a sterling bank account through the app to be deposited into your Barclays bank account ('the Service';)</p>
<p><strong>Depositing cheques using the Service</strong></p>
<p>By using the Service, you agree that</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll only submit eligible cheques that meet the standards we tell you</li>
<li>All information you give us is accurate and true</li>
<li>You agree to only use this Service in the United Kingdom, Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man and Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like traditional cheque deposits, there are some instances in which we are unfortunately unable to accept and process the cheques that we receive from you. We are not able to accept the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheques payable to another person or entity (ie cheques not in your name)</li>
<li>Cheques containing obvious alterations or that you think, suspect or know to have been altered, forged or unauthorised by the drawer</li>
<li>Cheques previously deposited using the Service</li>
<li>Cheques not payable in sterling (cheques in another currency)</li>
<li>Travellers cheques, bankers’ drafts or other bills that aren’t cheques;</li>
<li>Post-dated cheques (on the date you submit them)</li>
<li>Cheques dated more than 6 months before the date of deposit</li>
<li>Cheques that breach the Service or our agreement with you;</li>
<li>Any other cheques or items we tell you about from time to time;</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also reject the following items</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate items</li>
<li>Items that exceed our deposit limits </li>
<li>Deposits from an account that’s been closed or switched </li>
<li>Deposits from an ineligible account </li>
<li>Items that don’t contain any of the essential features</li>
<li>Items we consider illegible, invalid or in breach of our agreement with you</li>
<li>Items that may contain viruses or other inappropriate content</li>
</ul>
<p>Making sure your cheque has been completed correctly</p>
<p>Before submitting a cheque, you must make sure it has the following details (completed by the person paying you)</p>
<ul>
<li>Date – the cheque must have a date that’s less than 6 months before the date you want to deposit it but must not be post-dated when you submit it</li>
<li>Drawer’s name and signature</li>
<li>The amount – in words and figures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Image quality</strong></p>
<p>You must submit a legible image that meets the image standards we tell you when you register for or use the Service. You should place the cheque on a dark background, ensuring the image is in focus and the 4 corners of the cheque are visible when you capture the image. </p>
<p><strong>Processing your cheque</strong></p>
<p>Cheques deposited using the Service by 3.59pm on a weekday will be processed and credited to your Barclays account by 11.59pm the next weekday at the latest (Monday to Friday, except bank holidays).</p>
<p>We’ll only start processing a cheque when we receive it, ie when you successfully submit the cheque using the Service and we confirm its receipt. This doesn’t mean the cheque is error-free or complete. We can still review cheques and reject them at our discretion. For example, if there’s a discrepancy between the amount you’ve entered and the amount on the scanned image, we’ll return the cheque unpaid. </p>
<p>Unless we tell you otherwise, cheques will be presented and cleared as set out in our agreement with you.</p>
<p>Deposit limits</p>
<p>We’ll place limits (which we can change anytime) on the amounts and number of deposits that you can make using the Service. We’ll tell you the limits in the app.</p>
<p><strong>What else we need you to do</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to keep the original cheque for 10 days after we credit your Barclays account. During this period, we might ask you to provide us with the original cheque – well let you know why (for example, to resolve a dispute). Once you’ve submitted an image, you can’t present the original cheque or image again for payment, either at Barclays or another bank.</p>
<p><strong>If something goes wrong</strong></p>
<p>We’re responsible to you as set out in the general terms of your Barclays account.</p>
<p>You authorise us to take a cheque payment back out of your Barclays account – even if we’ve allowed you to make a payment or take cash out against it – in any of the following cases </p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re not the correct payee for the cheque, or the name of the payee doesn’t match with your Barclays account</li>
<li>If we’re told or become aware that a cheque was incorrectly paid into your Barclays account</li>
<li>If we credit your Barclays account but the cheque is unpaid (bounces)</li>
<li>If the cheque has material errors or is missing any of the essential features set out in condition 4 </li>
<li>If the cheque had already been paid, stopped or blocked by the time you submitted it</li>
<li>If you’re unable or unwilling to produce the original cheque on request, within the agreed period</li>
<li>If we do take a cheque payment out of your account, we’ll write to you and explain why.</li>
<li>We can block your use of the Service and we’ll write to you to explain why. We can also end our relationship with you if you break the terms of this agreement. If we end our relationship with you, we’ll write to you to explain why.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using your information</strong></p>
<p>We’ll use your information as set out in the general terms for your Barclays account. We’ll contact you from time to time about the Service, including upgrades, changes, marketing or other messages relating to the Service. We’ll do this electronically, for example, by email, SMS or other messages. We won’t send you marketing communications if you’ve previously advised us that you don’t wish to receive these types of communications.</p>
<p>From time to time, updates to the Mobile Cheque Deposit operating systems and software may be issued and you may not be able to use the app until you’ve downloaded the latest software updates and accepted any new terms.</p>
<h5>Part E – Invoicing</h5>
<p><strong>What is invoicing?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re an eligible business customer, invoices let you create, track, manage, view and issue invoices to clients via the app.</p>
<p><strong>How does invoicing work?</strong></p>
<p>When an invoice is created, this will appear in the form of a PDF and will be sent to the recipient from your email address as a PDF attachment. When creating and sending an invoice, it is your responsibility to ensure that the correct details are used for the intended recipient. Failure to do so may result in both your data and your customers' data being shared with an unknown third party.</p>
<p>Invoices issued are in respect of goods and services provided by you. Invoicing does not provide any additional product or service to you or the recipient of the invoice. The contract that is formed for the supply of goods and services will be between you and the recipient, and it is your responsibility to ensure that you have separate terms and conditions in place.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>To utilise this invoicing functionality, you must be registered to use the app and have a valid Barclays Business current account. We reserve the right to amend this without notice and restrict access at our discretion as we might change the eligibility criteria.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if something goes wrong?</strong></p>
<p>If something goes wrong when someone is trying to make a payment to you (for example, you don't get a payment you're expecting) we'll do our best to help you as long as you've been honest about what's going on and kept us informed. Please refer to your general terms or get in touch with the helpdesk for more information.</p>
<p><strong>How we use your information</strong></p>
<p>We will only use the client data you enter into an invoice for the purposes of creating the invoice and any other legal or regulatory requirements we may have in this regard as a data processor. It is your responsibility to ensure all information or files used to create the invoice are accurate and you confirm that you have the necessary rights and permissions to process the data you enter into any invoice.</p>
<h5>Part F – Open Banking</h5>
<p><strong>What does Open Banking mean for the app?</strong><br />
</p>
<p>If you're a UK based Personal current account or UK Wealth customer, you can choose to view certain sterling and non-sterling savings and payment accounts (including credit cards) held with other banking providers that are supported within the app. You can also initiate payments from your sterling current accounts held with other banking providers using the app. </p>
<p>To provide these services, we’ll need to request data from your other bank. Before we do that, we will ask your permission. If you give your permission, we’ll request information on your accounts, including account identifier, product type, balances and up to two years of transactions. You’ll need to confirm your permission with us every 90 days. You’re only permitted to view or initiate payments from sterling current accounts that are held in your name or accounts over which you have appropriate authority. Your other banking provider may refuse to share the data with us if you don’t have appropriate authority over the account.</p>
<p>You can stop sharing your data with us at any time from within the app. Simply go to ‘Settings’ and ‘Third-party permissions’. If you do this, we’ll stop requesting your data from the other provider immediately. If you cancel your app registration or close your Barclays accounts, you won’t be able to use this service anymore.</p>
<p>We aren’t liable for the accuracy of the data we receive from other banking providers. If something happens that's beyond our control and we're unable to provide this service, we can remove or suspend access to this service without notice.</p>
<h5>Part G – Becoming a Barclays customer<br />
</h5>
<p>You can use the app to become a Barclays customer. As part of the registration process we will ask you to share personal data with us, including three years of address history, a form of photographic identification and a short selfie video. We will share this data with our trusted 3rd parties for the purposes of verifying the data you have provided so we are sure it’s you. If you can’t complete your application straightaway, we’ll hold your data for 90 days to give you time to continue your application from where you left off. After this, you’ll need to provide all your information again if you apply for an account. For more detailed information on how and why we use your information, including the rights in relation to your personal data, and our legal grounds for using it, please go to https://www.barclays.co.uk/important-information/control-your-data/.<br />
</p>
<h5>Part H – Other things you need to know</h5>
<p><strong>If you’re unhappy with something</strong><br />
</p>
<p>If you're unhappy with the app or feel we have done something wrong, please contact us and give us the opportunity to investigate and resolve the matter. This also helps improve our service for all customers.</p>
<p><strong>If you remain unhappy</strong></p>
<p>If after we have investigated you remain unhappy, you may be able to contact the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). The Financial Ombudsman is a free, independent service for resolving disputes between customers and financial services institutions. If you're eligible to make a complaint to the FOS, you'll need to contact them within 6 months of our final response letter – and they'll ask to see the letter as summary of our investigation of your complaint.</p>

<p><strong>Online Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The European Commission has set up an online dispute resolution platform (ODR platform) to help customers who have bought goods or services online from traders established in the European Union. If you have not been able to get your complaint resolved to your satisfaction, you can submit your complaint online through the ODR platform. The platform will then send your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) for an independent review. To save time you may wish to contact the FOS directly, using the details provided in the terms and conditions for your product.</p>
<p>As a Barclays customer, you may use this service if you purchased your product or service with us online. You will need to quote our postal address, website address and email address.</p>
