</ul>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>If you have a Barclays current account</th>
</tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td><p>You can apply for a Pack through Online Banking or the Barclays app.<br />
</p>
<p>These terms cover your Pack. If there’s inconsistency between these and the Retail Customer Agreement, these terms take priority in relation to the Packs.</p>
<p>Each of the benefits and services in the Pack are provided to you under a separate agreement with the provider of the relevant benefits or services and the provider is responsible for providing the relevant benefits and services to you. The provider may be a company within the Barclays group of companies or by a company outside that group.</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>A Pack is a set of services (such as insurance) available to any eligible person aged 18+ for a monthly fee. You can only purchase a Pack and claim the benefits included in it if you are a UK resident. </p>
<h3><strong>Eligibility for Pack benefits</strong></h3>
<p>Before choosing a Pack, you should check that you are eligible for the benefits under each policy or feature. We will provide information and ask you questions to help you do this. For instance, you may not be eligible to claim for certain benefits because of your age or you have a pre-existing medical condition.</p>
<h3><span class="body"><strong>What you pay</strong></span></h3>
<p>You pay a monthly fee in advance for each Pack purchased, as set out in the ‘Statement of Price’ within the About Our Insurance Services section. The Pack fee includes Insurance Premium Tax at the current rate. The monthly fee is the cost of the Pack as a whole. No part of any Pack fee is attributable to any particular benefit or service in your Pack. You will not be entitled to a refund or reduction in the Pack fee if you choose not to use a benefit or service, you’re not eligible for a benefit or service, or it’s not otherwise available to you. You must have a Pack for a minimum term of six months from the date you purchase the Pack (unless we say otherwise in these terms) after which you can close the Pack at any time.</p>
<p>You may be able to add additional features to the services included in a Pack and we’ll tell you what these cost before you choose to add them.</p>
<p>By agreeing to these terms and conditions you provide Barclays authority to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">(i)    debit a part payment of the monthly Pack fee to cover the period from the date on which you purchase the Pack, up to the last day of that month; and thereafter<br />
(ii)   debit the monthly Pack fee<br />
(iii)  apply a change to the monthly Pack fee subject to the appropriate notice period.</p>
<p>All payments will be taken in advance from your Barclays current account on the first working day of the month on an ongoing basis until your Pack is cancelled. You must ensure you have sufficient credit funds in your Barclays current account to cover the monthly Pack fee, otherwise you may incur borrowing charges in line with any arrangement you have with us.</p>
<h3><strong>Keeping each other informed</strong></h3>
<p>We need you to tell us about changes to your situation or personal details, and we’ll keep you informed about certain things that affect you. Information will only be sent to you, the Pack holder. </p>
<h4><strong>How we contact you</strong></h4>
<p>We’ll contact you, the Pack holder, using the details you have given to us. This may include using your landline phone, mobile, email or home address. If you have a Barclays current account, we may also contact you through Online Banking or the Barclays app if you use these.</p>
<p>You can tell us how you want us to contact you, for example by post or your available digital channel. Where we can, we’ll contact you using your preferred method. We may not always be able to do this – for example, sometimes the law may require us to send you something by post. If we send information to you at the most recent postal address you have given us and it's returned to us as undelivered, we’ll stop using that address unless we are required by law or regulation to send you information.</p>
<p>If you have not told us how you’d prefer us to communicate, then we’ll normally contact you by email. If we send you information through Barclays Online Banking, we’ll text you or send you an email or other electronic message reminding you to view any new message we’ve posted. Where we do this, we won’t normally send documents to your home address as well (unless we have to or you have asked us to).</p>
<p>Once we’ve sent a message to you, we’ll assume you have received it. So it’s important to look out for notifications like emails or texts from us.</p>
<p>We are always working to make our services more convenient and flexible so we may introduce new ways of communicating with you in the future.</p>
<h4><strong>Help us to keep your information private</strong></h4>
<p>It’s your responsibility to control who reads your information. When you choose how you would like us to contact you, you should choose a method that will be most secure for you. If you use a method that other people can access or read (such as a shared email address or shared mobile number), please be aware that these people will also be able to access the information we send you.</p>
<h4><strong>Keeping your details up to date</strong></h4>
<p>When we send information to you, we’ll send it to the most recent contact details we have for you. If these details change and you don’t tell us straight away, you may not receive information that could be important – or it could fall into the wrong hands. If you have given us contact details (even if you think we don’t use some of them, such as your mobile phone number), you must let us know if they change. This will include your:</p>
<ul>
<li>home address</li>
<li>email address</li>
<li>landline phone number</li>
<li>mobile phone number</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s very important that you also keep us informed if there are any changes to your situation, personal details or any other important changes that are relevant to us – for example, if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>change your name</li>
<li>move to another country and are no longer a UK resident</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t keep all your details up to date, this might affect your eligibility for Pack(s), or how they work. This is also so we can continue to manage your Pack(s), and communicate with you including notifying you of changes. We also respect your privacy and we don’t want to send you unwanted information.</p>
<p>If you wish to remove or change the Partner named on the Pack(s), we’ll close your Pack(s) to do this before opening a new Pack(s). The minimum term will re-start upon the purchase of a new Pack(s).<br />
</p>
<h4><strong>Contacting us</strong></h4>
<p>You can always contact us through your available digital channel, or other electronic methods we tell you about. You can also contact us by telephone using the details we give you, by visiting a branch or by post. We’ll let you know if our details change.</p>
<p>You can contact us by any of the following methods:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into the Barclays app and select the ‘call us’ feature</li>
<li>By telephone on <strong>0800 158 3199</strong></li>
<li>Visit your local branch</li>
<li>In writing to <strong>Barclays, Leicester LE87 2BB</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Closing your Pack or leaving Barclays</strong></h3>
<p>Whilst we’d be very sorry to lose you, you can close your Pack within the 14-day cooling off period, which starts the day your Pack is purchased or you receive your Welcome Pack, whichever is later. If you close your Pack within this period and have paid your first monthly Pack fee, it will be refunded. You can also cancel or close your Pack at any time after the minimum term explained below has ended. If we need to close your Pack, we’ll follow the process set out below.</p>
<h4><strong>Duration and Minimum Term</strong></h4>
<p>You must have a Pack for a minimum term of six months from the date you open the Pack, after which the Pack will automatically renew on a monthly basis and after which you can close the Pack at any time. There are some exceptions to this minimum term requirement. You may close your Pack:</p>
<ul>
<li>within the 14-day cooling-off period as set out above</li>
<li>if you experience financial hardship due to a significant change in personal circumstances, for example, you’re declared bankrupt</li>
<li>if you’re no longer resident in the UK</li>
<li>after we have notified you of an unfavourable change to the terms of the Pack you hold, such as an increase in price or a change in what the Pack provides (provided that you do so before the change takes effect)</li>
<li>if you have Travel Pack or Travel Plus Pack and are no longer eligible for the travel insurance benefit as you are 80 years of age</li>
<li>if you have Travel Pack or Travel Plus Pack and serious ill health, injury or mental incapacity prevents you from travelling or death of the Pack holder, spouse/partner</li>
</ul>
<p>If you tell us you want to close your Pack, closure will take effect on the day that we receive notice from you (so the insurance and your right to receive any of the other services within the Pack will end on the date we receive your notice). You will receive a part refund for the remaining number of days in that month, including the day we receive your notice. You won’t be able to use any benefits or services linked to it any more although you can still make a claim for an event which occurred whilst you were insured. </p>
<p>We will not let you re-select the same Pack for 12 months if you cancel it within the minimum term, or your Barclays current account is closed by Barclays Financial Assistance or if you do not comply with these terms and conditions. </p>
<p>You are unable to cancel individual insurance Pack products, only the whole Pack.</p>
<p>You can cancel your Pack within the Barclays app, Online Banking, by calling us, visiting a branch or by writing to Barclays, Leicester LE87 2BB.</p>
<h4><strong>When we can close a Pack</strong></h4>
<p>We can close a Pack by giving you at least 30 calendar days’ notice. This also applies during the minimum term. However, we may close your Pack immediately or on less notice if we reasonably believe you have seriously or persistently broken any terms of the agreement or we reasonably believe any of the following applies:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>you put us in a position where we might break a law, regulation, code or other duty that applies to us if we maintain your Pack</li>
<li>you give us any false or inaccurate information at any time</li>
<li>you commit (or attempt) fraud against us or someone else</li>
<li>you behave in a threatening or abusive manner to our staff</li>
<li>you become bankrupt</li>
<li>your Barclays current account is closed by Barclays Financial Assistance</li>
</ul>
<p>The insurer may also cancel the insurance policies within Travel Plus Pack as set out in the terms and conditions of the policy document.</p>
<h3><strong>Using the Current Account Switch Service</strong></h3>
<p>If you decide to switch your current account from us by using the Current Account Switch Service, your Pack will be closed on the same day that your Current Account is closed.</p>
<h3><strong>Changes we can make to this agreement</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes we’ll want or need to change things, such as charges or terms of our agreement. For most changes, we’ll tell you in advance, but we don’t always need to do this.</p>
<p>We review the Packs from time to time and may make changes to them, including the benefits and services included in a Pack or the providers of these or the monthly Pack fee. We may also make changes to the terms on which each benefit is provided (such as changes to the terms of an individual policy). We’ll give you 30 calendar days’ notice before any changes apply.</p>
<p>If we make changes to a Pack, we will provide information about you to any new provider to make sure there is no interruption in the benefit or service you receive. The new provider will use your information to provide you with the benefits and services.</p>
<h4><strong>Changes we need to tell you about in advance</strong></h4>
<p>We may make changes to your agreement with us because:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>we’re changing a service we already offer, or introducing a new service that needs a change to the terms of this agreement, such as introducing a new charge</li>
<li>we’re changing the agreement to be in line with the banking industry and our competitors</li>
<li>we’re withdrawing a service or type of Pack</li>
<li>we’re moving you from one type of Pack to another for a good reason – examples of this include where we’re withdrawing a Pack</li>
<li>we need to make changes to take account of developments (or changes we reasonably expect to help) in technology (including the systems we use to run our business), or in the banking system generally</li>
<li>our agreement or the Pack is affected by a change in the law or regulation (including industry codes we follow) or decisions of the Financial Ombudsman, a regulator or court</li>
<li>changes in our costs (including changes we reasonably expect to happen) mean we need to change or introduce charges</li>
</ul>
<p>Because you may have your Pack with us for many years, we need the flexibility to manage our business long term, including providing a sufficient financial return for us to operate our business in a prudent and sustainable manner. We can’t predict everything that may affect our business, so there may be other reasons we have not set out above when we need to make a change. But please be assured we’ll only make changes we think are fair and will give you 30 calendar days' notice of the change unless we are prevented from doing so by law or regulation, or the change is in your favour.</p>
<p>If we give you notice as set out above and you don’t tell us you want to close your Pack, then we’ll treat you as having accepted the change. If you don’t want to accept the change and want to end this agreement and close the Pack, you must tell us before the proposed change applies.</p>
<h4><strong>Changes we don’t need to tell you about in advance</strong></h4>
<p>We don’t have to tell you about changes to these terms and conditions (or changes in the insurer terms and conditions) in advance when any of the following happen:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>if the change is in your favour</li>
<li>we make a change because a change in law or regulation says that we have to by a particular date, and there isn’t time to give you notice.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Instructions for your Pack(s)</strong></h4>
<p>We will only accept instructions from the Pack holder about the Pack (including to change your contact preferences and to apply for new Packs, products and services). </p>
<p>Your partner will be able to register a product, if required, or make a claim for the Pack benefits or services. They cannot provide any other instructions in relation to the Pack.</p>
<h4><strong>If you think your security has been compromised</strong></h4>
<p>If you think someone (except someone you have asked to provide Pack information) has used or is able to use any of the means of access to your Pack, you must tell us as soon as you can by using the contact details shown in the ‘Unauthorised access to your Pack?’ section.</p>
<p>If you have a Barclays current account, we can arrange to temporarily suspend access to a service (such as Telephone Banking) to prevent anyone misusing your Pack(s).</p>
<p>You must give us any information we ask for about what has happened. We’ll pass this to the police if we have to, or if we think that will be useful.</p>

<h3>2. Making a claim</h3>
<h5><strong>What you need to do</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>If you have a medical emergency contact the 24-hour Medical Assistance number on 0044 1603 604 976</strong></h5>
<p>In life-threatening situations seek medical attention immediately, don’t delay getting help but do call our 24-hour medical assistance helpline as soon as you can. Our team will coordinate your treatment which may include moving you to another hospital or arranging to bring you home early. If necessary, we can arrange for a telephone consultation with our UK GPs.</p>
<p>In non life-threatening situations contact our 24-hour medical assistance helpline before making any arrangements for</p>
<ul>
<li>Admission to hospital</li>
<li>Treatment, tests or investigations as an outpatient</li>
<li>Repeat consultations with a doctor</li>
</ul>
<p>For a minor illness or injury treated with medication from a pharmacy or one-off treatment at a clinic, keep any receipts for costs incurred and contact us when you get home. If you need assistance contact the 24 hour medical assistance helpline at any time.</p>
<h5><strong>Unrecoverable costs</strong></h5>
<p>Your travel policy provides cover for unrecoverable costs. If you need to make a claim for travel, accommodation or costs related to your trip which any insured person has paid (or legally has to pay), we will consider claims for costs which are unrecoverable from your travel and/or accommodation provider or agent, a debit/credit card company, PayPal, ABTA, ATOL (or similar organisations).</p>
<p>For example, if your trip is cancelled by your tour operator or booking agent you may have a right to a refund for some or all of the cost of your trip.</p>
<p>If you can’t recover all of your costs and your circumstances are covered by the terms of your policy, we’ll consider the costs you’ve been unable to recover.</p>
<h5><strong>Information to support your claim</strong></h5>
<p>When you make a claim, we may ask you for</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof of booking and any costs paid</li>
<li>Details of any refund you have been able to obtain</li>
<li>Evidence that you’re not able to recover your costs elsewhere </li>
</ul>
<p>Please check these terms and conditions carefully to ensure you<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand what is and isn’t covered</li>
<li>Contact the relevant helpline as soon as you can for assistance</li>
<li>Keep any documentation that we require. You’ll need to provide this in order for us to validate and settle your claim – we may refuse to pay your costs where you cannot provide this</li>
</ul>
<p>All our claims lines are open 24 hours a day, and for claims which aren’t an emergency you can also make a claim online. See section ‘1. How to get help’ for full information.</p>

<h5><strong>Limits and excesses</strong></h5>
<p>All limits in this policy are per person (apart from Personal liability, which is per incident, per policy).</p>
<p>You’ll need to pay the first £50 of any claim per insured person, per incident, per trip (unless stated otherwise). This means that if the total value of your claim is less than £50 we won’t make any payment to you.</p>
<p>If any one incident results in you claiming under more than one section of the policy you’ll only pay one excess, and where two or more people claim for the same incident, the most you’ll pay is twice the excess.</p>
<h4><strong>Claims conditions</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Your duties</strong></h5>
<p>You must</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact us as soon as reasonably possible and provide all the information, documents, evidence and help we need to settle your claim or pursue a recovery</li>
<li>Tell us if you’re aware of any writ, summons or prosecution</li>
<li>Send us every communication relating to a claim as soon as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>You or any person acting for you, must not negotiate, admit or reject any claim without our permission in writing.</p>
<h5><strong>Our rights</strong></h5>
<p>If we want to, we can take over and conduct in the name of the person claiming under the policy, the defence or settlement of any claim or issue proceedings for our own benefit to recover any payment we have made under this policy. We shall have full discretion in the conduct of any proceedings or the settlement of any claim.</p>
<h5><strong>Claims</strong></h5>
<p>You or your legal representative must pay for any certificates, information, or other evidence we may need. For example death or medical certificates, medical reports, police reports or purchase receipts. These costs will not be covered by the policy. We may also ask you for evidence that your main home is in the UK.</p>
<p>If your claim is for personal belongings (or winter sports equipment) it may affect your claim if you cannot prove the value of, and that you were responsible for the lost, stolen, or damaged items. For example a receipt or credit card or bank statement showing evidence of the purchase, proof of withdrawal or a currency exchange receipt. If you’re claiming for damage, we may ask you to send us the broken item.</p>
<p>If we make a payment before cover is confirmed and our claims investigation reveals that no cover exists, you must pay us back any amount which we’ve paid that you’re not covered for.</p>
<p>If you make a medical claim, you may be asked to provide consent for us to access your medical reports in accordance with the Access to Medical Reports Act 1998. Depending on the circumstances, you may also be asked for consent to access other medical or healthcare records. We’ll use this information to deal with your claim, including assessing whether cover applies and assisting the treating doctor in providing you with the most appropriate treatment. Without this information, we may not be able to deal with your claim.</p>
<p>We’ll assess whether any proposed treatment is an emergency or whether it can wait until you’ve returned home. If appropriate, we’ll arrange for your return to the UK.</p>
<p>In the event of a claim for injury or illness, we may request and pay for you to be medically examined on our behalf. We may request and pay for a post-mortem in the event of a claim for death.</p>

<li>‘Your children’ - you and/or your partner’s dependent children aged under 23 when the trip starts (including stepchildren and foster children)</li>
</ul>
<p>Children are only covered when travelling with you or your partner, or on their own to stay at the home of close relatives who live abroad.</p>
<p>To be covered, your main home address must be in the UK. Additionally, all insured persons must</p>
<ul>
<li>Be a resident of the UK (living in the UK for more than 183 days a year)</li>
<li>Be registered with a UK doctor</li>
</ul>
<p>Cover will be in place whilst you are a holder of this Pack and will end when one of the ‘Automatic termination of cover’ events shown in section ‘6. General Conditions’ occurs.</p>
<h5><strong>Trip limits and restrictions</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Trip duration limit</strong></h5>
<p>We’ll provide the insured persons with the cover set out in these terms and conditions for trips up to a maximum of 31 days long (except winter sports which is covered for a maximum of 31 days per calendar year). We won’t cover any incident which occurs after 31 days unless an upgrade has been purchased.</p>
<h5><strong>Longer trip upgrade</strong></h5>
<p>If anyone insured by this policy is booking a trip that will last longer than 31 days, this upgrade will provide cover for the entire duration of the trip up to a maximum of 120 days. A return trip must have been booked before you can buy this upgrade. To find out how to get a quote see section ‘1. How to get help’.</p>
<p>If we offer an upgrade, there will be a premium for you to pay. The upgrade is not available for winter sports holidays. We won’t cover any incident which occurs after the trip duration has been reached.</p>
<p>By ‘trip’ we mean a journey that begins and ends in England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland (‘UK’), where the journey starts after the Pack was purchased, and where the return journey has been booked before leaving the UK, for any combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holidays, for example winter sports holidays, cruises, and travel for other personal reasons unrelated to an insured person’s employment</li>
<li>Voluntary, charity or conservation work, or fundraising for a registered charity or conservation organisation</li>
<li>Travel outside the UK in connection with an insured person’s job to carry out non-manual work such as administrative tasks, meetings and conferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cover automatically applies for each trip booked. You only need to contact us if you need cover for pre-existing medical conditions, or if a trip’s being booked to last longer than 31 days.</p>
<p>If a trip or part of a trip is arranged for any reason other than those listed above, alternative travel insurance should be sought, we won’t pay any claim in these circumstances. If a trip is in connection with an insured person’s job, they should check if the employer has travel insurance that can provide cover.</p>
<h5><strong>UK trips</strong></h5>
<p>If the trip is solely within the UK, cover will only apply where the insured person is away from home for at least 2 consecutive nights. They must also have either pre-booked holiday accommodation in a commercially run premises, or prepaid bookings on public transport including flights or ferries.</p>
<h5><strong>We won’t cover</strong></h5>
<p>Any part of any trip arranged</p>
<ul>
<li>that started before the Pack was purchased.</li>
<li>in connection with an insured person’s job where the trip involves manual or physical work of any kind, working with children, providing healthcare, policing, security or military service or an insured person’s role as a politician, religious leader, professional entertainer or sportsperson.</li>
<li>to carry out charity or conservation work where this involves working in a healthcare environment or working at heights of more than 3 metres.</li>
<li>to seek medical treatment or advice.</li>
<li>to give birth or to collect newly adopted or surrogate children.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Known events</strong></h4>
<p>This policy provides cover for unexpected and unforeseen events and circumstances, for example, having an accident while on holiday and needing urgent medical treatment.</p>
<h5><strong>We won’t cover</strong></h5>
<p>There is no cover in relation to any event, incident or circumstances if, at the time you purchased this Pack or a trip was booked (whichever is later), the insured person knew, or could reasonably be expected to have known, that</p>
<ul>
<li>the event or incident had already occurred or was going to occur; or</li>
<li> the circumstances existed, or were going to exist,</li>
</ul>
<p>and the event, incident or circumstances could reasonably be expected to affect the insured person’s travel plans.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>You’d reasonably be expected to know of any event, incident or circumstances (like an air traffic control strike) that had been widely reported in the media in the UK at the time you purchased this Pack or booked your trip (whichever is later).</p>
<p>There’d be no cover for cancellation of your trip if your travel plans were disrupted because flights were cancelled or any government or authority closed their borders, and these cancellations or restrictions were in place or had been announced at the time you purchased your Pack or booked your trip (whichever is later).</p>
<p>Please refer to section ‘6. General Exclusions’.</p>
<h4><strong>Travel advice of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO)</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>FCDO – travel advice by country</strong></h5>
<p>Any travel restrictions or advisory notices for countries planned to visit may impact the cover provided by this policy.</p>
<p>We’ll provide cover should a trip be booked and then the insured person needs to cancel the trip or return home early as a result of the FCDO advising against all travel or all but essential travel to the destination, or where British nationals are advised to return home.</p>
<p>Before booking a trip and again before travelling, check the FCDO website <strong>gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice</strong> - it’s packed with essential travel advice and tips, plus up to date information about different countries.</p>
<h5><strong>We won’t cover</strong></h5>
<p>Any claim that happens as a result of an insured person</p>
<ul>
<li>travelling against the advice of the FCDO.</li>
<li>not complying with advice or measures which have been put in place by a government in the UK or overseas, for example quarantine rules or curfews.</li>
<li>not having the correct travel documents or not meeting the entry requirements to a country they’re travelling to or through (for example visas or vaccination records).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Reciprocal healthcare agreements</strong></h4>
<p>The UK has reciprocal healthcare agreements with a number of countries and territories worldwide. As a UK resident, these agreements mean that you may be entitled to urgent medical treatment at a reduced cost, or in some cases for free. We strongly recommend checking if the country being travelled to has a reciprocal healthcare agreement in place and what the requirements are before leaving the UK. More information can be found online at <strong>nhs.uk </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">and search for healthcare abroad.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Period of Insurance</strong></h4>
<p>Each trip taken whilst the Pack is in force will be treated as a separate period of insurance; individually <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">subject to all policy terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions. Cover for each separate trip applies as follows</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Cancellation cover begins from the date you purchase the Pack or the date of booking each separate trip (whichever is later) and ends when the insured person leaves home to start the trip</li>
<li>Cover under all other sections begins when the insured person leaves home to start the trip, and ends upon returning home providing that the trip does not exceed the trip limit of <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">31 days (unless you’ve purchased the Longer trip upgrade). There’s no cover for any incident that occurs after the trip duration has been reached.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Extension of cover</strong></h5>
<p>If the insured person can’t get back to the UK before the trip limit ends, this insurance will remain in force</p>
<ol>
<li>for up to 14 days if any vehicle the insured person is travelling in breaks down or their pre-booked transport is cancelled or delayed.</li>
<li>for as long as is deemed medically necessary by us for the insured person to remain abroad (having consulted with their treating doctor), providing there’s a valid claim for emergency medical treatment under this policy.</li>
<li>for as long as is necessary in the event the insured person is quarantined.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Information and changes we need to know about</strong></h4>
<p>You must take reasonable care to provide complete and accurate answers to the questions asked when you take out this Pack or make changes to it.</p>
<p>When we are notified of a change, we’ll let you know if it affects your policy. For example whether we’re able to accept the change and if so, whether the change will result in revised terms or an additional premium. If the information provided by you is not complete and accurate, depending upon the information that you’ve given us, we may</p>
<ul>
<li>amend the underwriting decision(s) for declared pre-existing medical condition(s) which may result in accepted conditions being excluded or an additional premium.</li>
<li>refuse to pay any claim.</li>
<li>cancel this policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to tell Barclays</p>
<ul>
<li>if you move address. If this means that you are no longer a UK resident or your main address is no longer in the UK then all the cover under this policy will end.</li>
<li>if you change your name (this affects our ability to maintain and service your policy).</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Your health</h3>
<h5><strong>Pre-existing medical conditions – please read this section carefully.</strong></h5>
<p>This travel insurance is not a general health or private medical insurance policy and will only cover sudden and unexpected illness or accidents which happen after you purchase your Pack or book a trip (whichever is later).</p>
<p>In some cases, we may be able to offer cover for pre-existing medical conditions. You should read below to find out what medical conditions you need to tell us about and when you need to tell us.</p>
<h5><strong>What you need to tell us</strong></h5>
<p>By ‘pre-existing medical condition’ we mean any diagnosed illness, injury or disease where in the 12 months before purchasing your Pack or booking a trip (whichever is later) any of the following applies.</p>
<p>An insured person has</p>
<ul>
<li>been prescribed medication, including newly prescribed or repeat medication.</li>
<li>received or is awaiting medical treatment, investigations or tests carried out by a medical professional.</li>
<li>been referred to, or had follow up with a specialist or consultant.</li>
<li>been admitted to hospital or had surgery.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>When you need to tell us</strong></h5>
<ol>
<li>When you purchase your pack</li>
<li>If someone’s diagnosed with a new condition (and doesn’t have a valid upgrade in place), let us know before booking a trip</li>
<li>At expiry of a valid pre-existing conditions upgrade, we’ll remind you to do this when your upgrade is about to end.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use the <strong>Barclays app </strong>or<strong> Online Banking</strong> to let us know securely online about any medical conditions that you, your partner or your children have<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>If you have a pre-existing conditions upgrade in place, you don't need to tell us about changes to the health of anyone you’ve covered on the upgrade until it ends - see the information under the heading ‘Pre-existing conditions upgrade' for more information about how this works.</p>
<h5><strong>What’s not covered</strong></h5>
<p>Unless you have a valid upgrade in place, we won’t cover any claim for any insured person arising directly or indirectly from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any pre-existing medical condition</li>
<li>Any symptoms for which a diagnosis has been sought but not yet received, that the insured person was aware of prior to booking a trip (or purchasing a Pack, whichever is later)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you have a valid upgrade in place or not, there’s no cover for any claim for any insured person arising directly or indirectly from any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prescribed medication not being taken as directed.</li>
<li>Travelling against the advice of a doctor or purposely travelling without medical advice when it was reasonable to have consulted a doctor.</li>
<li>Travelling with the intention of seeking medical advice or treatment, undergoing medical investigations, or any complications or new conditions found as a result of that advice, treatment or investigation.</li>
<li>An insured person booking a trip or travelling when they have received a terminal prognosis.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pre-existing conditions upgrade</strong></h4>
<p>We’ll assess the information you give us about pre-existing medical conditions, and if cover can be offered, we’ll let you know whether there’ll be an additional cost to you.</p>
<h5><strong>How it works</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Where cover can be offered, you can choose whether to extend the travel insurance to cover claims arising from the insured person’s pre-existing medical conditions.</li>
<li>Once cover is in place there’s no need to tell us about changes to the health of the insured person(s) you’ve bought the upgrade for until the upgrade ends, we’ll cover changes to the conditions you told us about as well as any new symptoms, and any new diagnoses until the end date shown on your schedule.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Adding another person to your pre-existing conditions upgrade</strong></h5>
<p>If you already have an upgrade in place and there’s a change in another insured person’s health that means they need cover, we’ll add their details to the same upgrade. This means the end date on your schedule won’t change.</p>
<p>Where cover can be offered for the additional person and you choose to pay the premium, the cost you pay will be adjusted accordingly based on the number of days that person is covered.</p>
<h5><strong>Important information about the upgrade</strong></h5>
<ol>
<li>The pre-existing conditions upgrade is an annual contract and begins on the start date shown on the upgrade schedule, which will be provided to you when you take out or make changes to your cover. Cover will continue for a period of 12 months from the start date unless it is cancelled by you or us before then. See section ‘7. General conditions’ for full details about cancellation. The only exception to this is where the insured person(s) will reach the eligibility age limit within those 12 months, where this applies it will be made clear to you how long the cover will last when you take out your upgrade, and the dates of cover will be shown on your upgrade schedule.</li>
<li>If an insured person is on a trip when your upgrade expires the cover will cease when the trip ends.</li>
<li>We’ll contact you in writing at least 21 days before the end date on your schedule. To continue cover (including for any trips you’ve already booked), you’ll need to complete a new medical assessment. This is because we know your health changes over time, keeping your details updated annually means we can provide you with an accurate quote for the cover you need.</li>
<li>The upgrade is only valid if your Pack is active and you remain eligible for the travel insurance.</li>
<li>If you have a trip that was booked before the expiry date of your upgrade and we are unable to continue to cover your medical condition(s) you can make a cancellation claim.</li>
<li>Our risk assessment system is updated on a regular basis. This might mean that the cover we offer and the premium we charge for your medical conditions may change even if your health has not changed.</li>

<h5><strong>If an insured person is on a trip at the time an automatic termination event occurs, all cover will cease when the trip ends.</strong></h5>
<h4><strong>When we can make changes to your cover</strong></h4>
<p>We can, at any time and after taking a fair and reasonable view, make changes to your Travel Insurance terms and conditions, to reflect changes in our expectations of the future likely cost of providing cover. Policy cover may increase or decrease, but the changes will not be made for the sake of recouping past losses. When doing so we will only consider one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our experience and expectations of the cost of providing this product and/or other Aviva products of a similar nature.</li>
<li>Information reasonably available to us on the actual and expected claims experience of insurers of similar products.</li>
<li>Widely available economic information such as inflation rates and exchange rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we can, at any time and after taking a fair and reasonable view, make changes to your Travel Insurance terms and conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>to reflect changes (affecting us or your policy) in the law or regulation or the interpretation of law or regulation, or changes in taxation.</li>
<li>to reflect decisions or recommendations of an Ombudsman, regulator or similar person, or any code of practice, with which we intend to comply.</li>
<li>in order to make your policy clearer and fairer to you or to rectify any mistakes that may be discovered in due course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes (together with the reasons for such changes) will be notified to you in writing at least 30 days in advance.</p>
<h4><strong>Claims fraud</strong></h4>
<p>If your claim is in any way dishonest or exaggerated, we will not pay any benefit under this policy, and we may cancel your policy immediately and backdate the cancellation to the date of the fraudulent claim. We may also take legal action against you to include recovery of any sums paid to you in respect of the fraudulent claim.</p>
<h4><strong>Contribution to claim</strong></h4>
<p>If, at the time of an incident which results in a claim under this policy, there’s any other insurance or other source covering the same loss, damage, expense or liability, we’re entitled to approach that insurer and/or other source for a contribution towards the claim and will only pay our share.</p>
<h4><strong>Your duty to prevent injury, loss, theft or damage</strong></h4>
<p>You and all insured persons must take all reasonable precautions to protect yourselves, your property, and the property of others.</p>
<h4><strong>Transfer of rights</strong></h4>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights under this policy. A person, partnership (whether limited or not) or company who is not insured under this policy has no rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.</p>
<h4><strong>Payments made under compulsory insurance regulations and rights of recovery</strong></h4>
<p>If the law of a country in which this policy operates requires us to settle a claim which, if this law had not existed, we would not be obliged to pay, we shall be entitled to recover such payments from the relevant person insured or the person who incurred the liability.</p>
<h4><strong>Choice of law</strong></h4>
<p>The law of England and Wales will apply to this contract, unless</p>
<ul>
<li>You and we agree otherwise; or</li>
<li>At the date of the contract you are a resident of Scotland or Northern Ireland in which case (in the absence of agreement to the contrary) the law of that country will apply.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Use of language</strong></h4>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed, the contractual terms and conditions and other information relating to this contract will be in English.</p>
<h4><strong>Complaints</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>What to do if you are unhappy</strong></h5>
<p>If you are unhappy with any aspect of the handling of your claim we would encourage you, in the first instance, to seek resolution by contacting the Travel Claims Helpline number; or if your complaint is regarding anything else please contact the Customer Services Helpline number.</p>
<h5><strong>What will happen if you complain?</strong></h5>
<p>We aim to resolve all complaints as quickly as possible. If we are unable to resolve your concerns quickly, we will</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge your complaint promptly</li>
<li>Assign a dedicated complaint expert who will review your complaint</li>

<p>Depending on the circumstances of your claim you may be entitled to compensation from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if we cannot meet our obligations. See <strong>fscs.org.uk</strong></p>
<h3>Privacy overview</h3>
<h4><strong>Aviva privacy notice</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Personal information</strong></h5>
<p>We collect and use personal information about you so that we can provide you with a policy that suits your insurance needs. This notice explains the most important aspects of how we use your information but you can get more information about the terms we use and view our full privacy policy at <strong>aviva.co.uk/privacypolicy </strong>or request a copy by writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester LE7 1PD.</p>
<p>The data controller responsible for this personal information is Aviva Insurance Limited as the insurer of the product. Additional controllers include Barclays, who are responsible for the sale and distribution of the product, and any applicable insurers, reinsurers or brokers we use.</p>
<h5><strong>Personal information we collect and how we use it</strong></h5>
<p>We will use personal information collected from you and obtained from other sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>to provide you with insurance: we need this to decide if we can offer insurance to you and if so on what terms and also to administer your policy, handle any claims and manage any renewal</li>
<li>to support legitimate interests that we have as a business. We need this to:<ul>
<li>manage arrangements we have with our insurers, reinsurers and brokers we use, and for the detection and prevention of fraud</li>
<li>to meet any applicable legal or regulatory obligations: we need this to meet compliance requirements with our regulators (e.g. Financial Conduct Authority), to comply with law enforcement and to manage legal claims, and</li>
<li>to carry out other activities that are in the public interest: for example, we may need to use personal information to carry out anti-money laundering checks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use personal information about other people, for example family members you wish to insure on a policy. If you are providing information about another person we expect you to ensure that they know you are doing so. You might find it helpful to show them this privacy notice.</p>
<p>The personal information we collect and use will include name, address, date of birth and financial information. If a claim is made we will also collect personal information about the claim from you and any relevant third parties. We may also need to ask for details relating to the health or any unspent offences or criminal convictions of you or somebody else covered under your policy. We recognise that information about health and offences or criminal convictions is particularly sensitive information. We’ll ensure that we only use that information where we need <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">to for our insurance purposes (including assessing the terms of your insurance contract, dealing with changes to your policy and/or dealing with claims).</span></p>
<p>There may be times when we need consent to use personal information for a specific reason. If this happens we will make this clear to you at the time. If you give us consent to using personal information, you are free to withdraw this at any time by contacting us – refer to the ‘Contacting us’ details below. Please note that if consent to use this information is withdrawn we will not be able to continue to process the information you gave us for this/these purpose(s). This would not affect our use of the information where consent is not required.</p>
<p>Of course, you don’t have to provide us with any personal information, but if you don’t provide the information we need we may not be able to proceed with your application or any claim you make.</p>
<p>Some of the information we use as part of this application may be provided to us by a third party. This may include information already held about you within the Aviva group, including details from previous quotes and claims, information we obtain from publicly available records, our trusted third parties and from industry databases, including fraud prevention agencies and databases.</p>
<h5><strong>Credit Reference Agency Searches</strong></h5>
<p>To ensure the Insurer has the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide you with our best premium and payment options, the Insurer may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. The Insurer or their agents may undertake checks against publicly available information (such as electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims.</p>
<p>The identity of our Credit Reference Agency and the ways in which they use and share personal information, are explained in more detail at <strong>transunion.co.uk/crain</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Automated decision making</strong></h5>
<p>We carry out automated decision making to decide whether we can provide insurance to you and on what terms, deal with claims or carry out fraud checks. In particular we may use an automated underwriting engine to provide a quote for this product, using the information we have collected.</p>
<h5><strong>How we share your personal information with others</strong></h5>
<p><span class="body"></span>We may share your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>with the Aviva group, our agents and third parties who provide services to us, Barclays and other insurers (either directly or via those acting for the insurer such as loss adjusters or investigators) to help us administer our products and services</li>
<li>with regulatory bodies and law enforcement bodies, including the police, e.g. if we are required to do so to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation</li>
<li>with other organisations including insurers, public bodies and the police (either directly or using shared databases) for fraud prevention and detection purposes</li>
<li>with reinsurers who provide reinsurance services to Aviva and for each other in respect of risks underwritten by Aviva, with insurers who cover Aviva under its group insurance policies and with our brokers who arrange and manage such reinsurance and insurance arrangements. They will use your data to decide whether to provide reinsurance and insurance cover, arrange and manage such cover, assess and deal with reinsurance and insurance claims under such cover and to meet legal obligations. They will keep your data for the period necessary for these purposes and may need to disclose it to other companies within their group, their agents and third party service providers, law enforcement and regulatory bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the organisations we share information with may be located outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of information outside of Europe is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights. For more information on this please see our Privacy Policy or contact us.</p>
<h5><strong>How long we keep your personal information for</strong></h5>
<p>We maintain a retention policy to ensure we only keep personal information for as long as we reasonably need it for the purposes explained in this notice. We need to keep information for the period necessary to administer your insurance and deal with claims and queries on your policy.</p>
<p>We may also need to keep information after our relationship with you has ended, for example to ensure we have an accurate record in the event of any complaints or challenges, carry out relevant fraud checks, or where we are required to do so for legal, regulatory or tax purposes.</p>
<h5><strong>Your rights</strong></h5>
<p>You have various rights in relation to your personal information, including the right to request access to your personal information, correct any mistakes on our records, erase or restrict records where they are no longer required, object to use of personal information based on legitimate business interests, including profiling and marketing, ask not to be subject to automated decision making if the decision produces legal or other significant effects on you, and data portability. For more details in relation to your rights, including how to exercise them, please see our full privacy policy or contact us – refer to the ‘Contacting us’ details below.</p>
<h5><strong>Contacting us</strong></h5>
<p>If you have any questions about how we use personal information, or if you want to exercise your rights stated above, please contact our Data Protection team by either emailing them at <a href="mailto:dataprt@aviva.com"><strong>dataprt@aviva.com </strong></a>or writing to the Data Protection Officer, Pitheavlis, Perth PH2 0NH.</p>
<p>If you have a complaint or concern about how we use your personal information, please contact us in the first instance and we will attempt to resolve the issue as soon as possible. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office at any time.</p>
<h5><strong>Fraud prevention and detection</strong></h5>
<p>In order to prevent and detect fraud we may at any time share information about you with other organisations and public bodies including the police.</p>
<p>You should show this notice to anyone who has an interest in the insurance under the policy.</p>

<h5>You, your</h5>
<p>The persons named on the <strong>Travel Plus Pack </strong>as being covered under this policy.</p>
<h4><strong>Important info about your policy</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>This policy offers services for the <strong>breakdown </strong>of <strong>vehicles</strong>. It meets the demands and needs of those who wish to ensure the risk of <strong>breakdown </strong>is met now and in the future.</li>
<li>All requests for service must be made to <strong>us</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Your </strong>policy covers <strong>you </strong>in any <strong>vehicle. You </strong>can be a driver or <strong>passenger</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How long am I covered for and how many claims can I make?</strong></h4>
<p>This <strong>breakdown </strong>policy is a part of the <strong>Travel Plus Pack</strong>. <strong>You </strong>are covered while <strong>your Travel Plus Pack </strong>is active.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no limit on the number of <strong>claims you </strong>can make under <strong>UK </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">cover.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>European breakdown cover has a £2500 limit per <strong>claim</strong>. You can make up to 2 <strong>claims </strong>in each 12-month period (starting on the date you first added the <strong>Travel Plus Pack)</strong>. Each trip must be for no more than 90 days and must start and end at <strong>home</strong>. <strong>Your </strong>policy must be active for the duration of your trip.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What vehicles am I covered in?</strong></h4>
<p>Only <strong>vehicles </strong>that are privately owned or leased and used only for private use are covered. This means the vehicle should be registered in your name or another individual and used for social, domestic, pleasure, and commuting to and from a permanent place of work.</p>
<p>Cover is not provided for company cars or other <strong>vehicles </strong>used for business, even if you are not using it for business at the time. Business use includes hire and reward, delivery use and sign written vehicles.</p>
<h5>Caravans and trailers</h5>
<p><strong>In the UK</strong></p>
<p>If <strong>your caravan </strong>or <strong>trailer breaks down </strong>in the <strong>UK</strong>, <strong>we </strong>will only send help to try and repair it at the roadside. This could be a permanent or temporary repair. <strong>We </strong>will only recover a <strong>caravan </strong>if it is attached to a <strong>broken-down vehicle</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In Europe</strong></p>
<p><strong>We </strong>do not provide cover for <strong>caravans </strong>or <strong>trailers </strong>as standard, and if <strong>your caravan </strong>or <strong>trailer breaks down</strong>, no cover will be provided.</p>
<p>If, however, <strong>you </strong>are towing a <strong>caravan </strong>or <strong>trailer </strong>at the time <strong>your vehicle breaks down </strong>and <strong>we </strong>are unable to fix <strong>your vehicle </strong>at the roadside, <strong>we </strong>can recover <strong>your caravan </strong>or <strong>trailer </strong>together with <strong>your vehicle </strong>if <strong>you </strong>pay a supplement.</p>
<p><strong>We </strong>cannot arrange a replacement <strong>caravan </strong>or <strong>trailer </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">or guarantee a hire car with a tow bar.</span></p>
<p>If your <strong>vehicle </strong>has broken down, you may need to leave your <strong>caravan </strong>or <strong>trailer </strong>with the <strong>vehicle </strong>while it’s being repaired. If <strong>your </strong>vehicle can’t be repaired, <strong>we </strong>may have to bring it back to the <strong>UK </strong>with <strong>your vehicle.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We </strong>cannot normally provide a hire car with a tow bar, so if your <strong>caravan </strong>or <strong>trailer </strong>can’t be repaired <strong>you </strong>may need to leave the <strong>caravan </strong>or <strong>trailer </strong>with the <strong>vehicle </strong>while it is being repaired. It may become necessary to bring the <strong>caravan </strong>or <strong>trailer </strong>back to the <strong>UK </strong>together with the <strong>vehicle</strong>, if the <strong>vehicle </strong>cannot be repaired abroad by the planned return date.</p>

<p>If you have run out of fuel, we will attend and if possible provide you with enough fuel to get to the nearest filling station, but you will have to pay for the fuel. If that is not possible, we will tow you up to 10 miles.</p>
<p>In the event that an electric <strong>vehicle </strong>runs out of charge, <strong>we </strong>will either send a mobile electric charging vehicle (where available) to provide <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">enough charge to get you to the nearest charge point, or </span><strong>we </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">will recover the </span><strong>vehicle </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">and </span><strong>passengers </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">to the nearest charge point.</span></p>

<li>Arrange a second or extended recovery.</li>

<h4><strong>General conditions</strong></h4>
<p>These apply to all sections of this <strong>policy</strong>. If <strong>you </strong>do not meet them, <strong>we </strong>can refuse cover, cancel <strong>your </strong>policy, or both.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You </strong>must request services directly from <strong>us</strong>, as <strong>we </strong>will only provide cover if <strong>we </strong>make arrangements to help <strong>you</strong>.</li>
<li>Where the <strong>breakdown </strong>is caused by a component failure this must stop the <strong>vehicle </strong>working. Faulty air-conditioning or the illumination of a warning light for example would not, on its own, be a <strong>breakdown</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>We </strong>will not cover any <strong>claim </strong>where the <strong>vehicle </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">is already at a garage or other place of repair.</span></li>
<li>Where <strong>we </strong>deem, acting reasonably, that <strong>you </strong>requested service to avoid the cost of repairing the <strong>vehicle</strong>, or to correct an attempted repair by someone else, <strong>we </strong>will not provide cover.</li>
<li><strong>You </strong>(and a driver if <strong>you </strong>were not driving) must be with the <strong>vehicle </strong>at the time of the <strong>breakdown </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">and when </span><strong>we </strong>attend, if there is not, <strong>we </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">will not be able to provide service.</span></li>
<li><strong>We </strong>are not liable for any loss or damage to the contents of the <strong>vehicle</strong>.</li>
<li>Where <strong>we </strong>recover <strong>passengers </strong>under the age of 16, they must be accompanied by an adult.</li>
<li><strong>We </strong>will not allow animals in <strong>our </strong>vehicles, except assistance dogs. Any animals can remain in <strong>your vehicle </strong>at <strong>your </strong>own risk. <strong>We </strong>will not <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">be liable for any injury to animals, or damage caused by them. </span><strong>We </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">will not transport any livestock. </span><strong>We </strong>will not be responsible for any costs relating to animals.</li>
<li>The <strong>vehicle </strong>must not carry more <strong>passengers </strong>than the number stated in the <strong>vehicle’s </strong>registration document. Each <strong>passenger </strong>must have a separate fixed seat fitted to the manufacturer’s specification and any child <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">must occupy a properly fitted child seat where required.</span></li>
<li>Where <strong>we </strong>provide a repair to <strong>your vehicle</strong>, whilst <strong>we </strong>are responsible for that repair, this does not mean that <strong>we </strong>are confirming the legal and roadworthy condition of the <strong>vehicle</strong>. This remains <strong>your </strong>responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>We </strong>will not be responsible for any losses that <strong>you </strong>incur following a breakdown that are not expressly covered by this policy. For example, <strong>we </strong>will not pay for any loss of earnings or missed appointments.</li>
<li><strong>We </strong>do not guarantee that recovery to any garage will be during opening hours, or that repairs can start immediately. Whilst <strong>we </strong>will try to check that the garage will undertake the type of repairs required, <strong>we </strong>cannot guarantee this. <strong>We </strong>will not take responsibility for repairs <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">carried out at any garage, whether an </span><strong>approved garage </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">or not, and the contract for such repairs will be between </span><strong>you </strong>and the garage/repairer.</li>
<li><strong>We </strong>will not provide service under this <strong>policy </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">if </span><strong>we </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">are prevented from doing so in circumstances beyond </span><strong>our </strong>reasonable control, including, but not limited to, an act of terrorism, a pandemic or epidemic, extreme weather, the activities of civil or government authorities, industrial disputes, riots, war, or civil unrest. In these circumstances, <strong>we </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">will take steps to prevent or minimise the effects on </span><strong>our </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">services</span><strong>.</strong></li>
<li>The cost of the following is not covered by this policy:<ul>
<li>specialist resource;</li>
<li>tolls, ferries, congestion or low emission zone charges for <strong>your vehicle </strong>and <strong>our </strong>vehicle;</li>
<li>any damage to glass even if the damage means <strong>you </strong>cannot legally or safely drive. <strong>We </strong>will arrange transport to a local garage so <strong>you </strong>can arrange to get <strong>your vehicle </strong>fixed but <strong>you </strong>will have to pay for this;</li>
<li>spare tyres and wheels and repairing or sourcing them; or</li>
<li>recovery by someone other than <strong>RAC</strong>. If the emergency services, local authority, or any government agency are handling the <strong>breakdown</strong>, <strong>we </strong>will only attend and provide recovery once instructed to do so by them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In handling any claim there may be more than one option available to you under this policy. <strong>We </strong>will decide which is the most appropriate option based on <strong>our </strong>expertise in <strong>breakdown </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">situations. In doing so </span><strong>we </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">will act in consultation with </span><strong>you</strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">, and act reasonably at all times.</span></li>
<li>When <strong>we </strong>attend a <strong>breakdown</strong>, <strong>we </strong>may ask <strong>you </strong>to review a document or electronic form that records the condition of <strong>your vehicle. </strong>Please make sure this is accurate as <strong>we </strong>are not responsible for any errors or omissions.</li>
<li><strong>Your vehicle </strong>must be privately owned or leased and used only for private use, including use for social, domestic and pleasure purposes and commuting to and from a permanent place of work.</li>
<li>This policy does not cover:<ul>
<li>routine servicing, maintenance, or assembly of your <strong>vehicle</strong>;</li>
<li>caravan or trailers, except as described under Included benefits;</li>
<li><strong>your vehicle </strong>if it is used for business, including for example, company vehicles, vehicles that are sign–written, used for hire and reward or parcel delivery, even if <strong>you </strong>are using it for personal use at the time of <strong>breakdown</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>breakdowns </strong>that occur during activities or events that are not subject to the normal rules of the road, for example, <strong>breakdowns </strong>on a track day. <strong>We </strong>will not <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">attend </span><strong>breakdowns </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">on racetracks or where </span><strong>you </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">have been immediately recovered from a racetrack;</span></li>
<li><strong>breakdowns</strong> that occur, or recovery of the <strong>vehicle</strong> to a destination that is, off the public highway to which <strong>you</strong> or <strong>we</strong> have no legal access;</li>
<li><strong>your vehicle </strong>if it is not legally taxed, insured and holding a valid MOT which is required by law or is not being used in line with the manufacturer’s guidelines;</li>
<li><strong>vehicles </strong>that are not in a roadworthy condition. If <strong>we </strong>consider, acting reasonably, that the <strong>vehicle </strong>is not in a legal or roadworthy condition, <strong>we </strong>can refuse to <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">provide service. If </span><strong>you </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">can demonstrate that the </span><strong>vehicle </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">is roadworthy, </span><strong>we </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">will provide service;</span></li>
<li>any claim that is or may be affected by the influence of alcohol or drugs;</li>
<li>any <strong>breakdown </strong>that is caused by or as a result of vehicle theft or fire; or</li>
<li>any claim under this policy where the <strong>breakdown </strong>was first reported to us under a different membership; or</li>
<li>vehicle storage charges. If <strong>your vehicle </strong>is being stored, <strong>you </strong>will be contacted at <strong>your </strong>last known address with details of how to arrange collection and any fees which may be payable. In extreme instances, where the <strong>vehicle </strong>has not been collected and fees not paid, the <strong>vehicle </strong>may be disposed of and any outstanding fees will be deducted. <strong>You </strong>will be notified, in accordance with legislation, prior to this happening.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If <strong>you </strong>are asked to review and approve a document (either paper or electronic) recording the condition of <strong>your vehicle </strong>and <strong>our </strong>findings at the roadside, it is <strong>your </strong>responsibility <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">to ensure that the record is accurate and complete. </span><strong>We </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">will not be responsible for any errors or omissions.</span></li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Conditions specific to travel in Europe</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>You </strong>must be a permanent resident in the <strong>UK </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">during the period of cover.</span></li>
<li><strong>Claims </strong>made more than 24 hours after the <strong>breakdown </strong>may be declined in part or completely.</li>
<li>This policy does not cover:<ul>
<li><strong>Vehicle </strong>storage charges, other than under Getting your vehicle home;</li>
<li>The hire of minibuses, motorhomes, motorcycles, caravans, trailers, or vans;</li>
<li>Overloading of a <strong>vehicle </strong>under the laws in any country in which the <strong>vehicle </strong>is travelling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>You </strong>must comply with, and make sure the <strong>vehicle </strong>complies with all relevant laws of the countries <strong>you </strong>visit during a <strong>journey</strong>.</li>
<li>How <strong>we </strong>calculate the exchange rate:<ul>
<li>Any costs incurred directly by <strong>us </strong>in a currency other than GBP will be converted to GBP at the exchange rate used by <strong>us </strong>at the time;</li>
<li>Costs incurred by <strong>you </strong>in a currency other than GBP which are recoverable from <strong>us </strong>will be converted to GBP either:<ul>
<li>At the exchange rate used by <strong>our </strong>credit or debit card provider; or</li>
<li>At the exchange rate used by <strong>us </strong>when <strong>we </strong>receive <strong>your </strong>claim form if <strong>you </strong>paid in cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If <strong>your vehicle </strong>needs to be repaired following a <strong>breakdown</strong>, <strong>you </strong>must not delay or refuse repairs whilst <strong>you </strong>are in <strong>Europe</strong>. If <strong>you </strong>do, and in <strong>our </strong>reasonable opinion that would lead to additional costs being incurred, <strong>we </strong>reserve the right to refuse <strong>your claim </strong>under <strong>D3 (Onward Travel in Europe) </strong>or <strong>D4 (Getting your vehicle home)</strong>.</li>
<li>Where <strong>we </strong>arrange a hire car, taxi, hotel, or similar benefit under this policy, <strong>we </strong>will always try to find a suitable option that is available at the time, however:<ul>
<li><strong>we </strong>are not responsible for the quality or service of each individual hotel, train or taxi booked; and</li>
<li>for hire cars, whilst <strong>we </strong>use reputable companies, <strong>we </strong>are unable to and cannot be responsible for checking the condition of each vehicle or the quality of service provided by each company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the <strong>breakdown </strong>is caused by flooding brought about by adverse weather, <strong>we </strong>will only arrange for the <strong>vehicle </strong>to be taken to a local repairer. All further service will be an additional cost paid by <strong>you</strong>, or must be referred to <strong>your </strong>vehicle’s motor insurer</li>
</ol>

<h5><strong>Advice or information</strong></h5>
<p>We can only offer Travel Insurance and Car Breakdown Cover from single insurers, and we act on behalf of the insurer.</p>
<p>The features and terms and conditions of the benefits within the Travel Plus Pack may not be the same as those for similar products available with Barclays.</p>
<p>The Travel Plus Pack is provided on a non-advised basis. As such, we will only provide information on the Travel Plus Pack and we will not make a personal recommendation about the suitability of this Travel Plus Pack.</p>
<h5><strong>Compensation Scheme</strong></h5>
<p>We are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). You may be entitled to compensation from the FSCS if we cannot meet our obligations in relation to arranging the insurance in the Pack, depending on the type of business and the circumstances of the claim. Insurance arranging is covered for 90% of the compensation claim, without any upper <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">limit.

<h5><strong>Change of insurer</strong></h5>
<p>From time to time for commercial reasons we may decide to change the chosen insurer(s). If we do, we will write to you at least 30 days before we make any change, giving you details of the new insurer and any variations to the terms and conditions of cover.</p>
<p>Your cancellation rights are not affected.</p>
<h5><strong>Statement of Price</strong></h5>
<p>The monthly fee for your Pack is payable in advance on the first working day of each month. The monthly fee is currently £22.50. This fee includes Insurance Premium Tax at the current rate, and there are no further taxes or costs unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>If you start your Pack part way through a month you pay a proportion of the Pack fee to reflect the number of days in that month when you hold the Pack. Similarly, if you cancel your Pack part way through a month you will receive a part refund for the remaining number of days in that month. The total fee you will pay during the six month minimum term will vary depending on when you purchased your Pack. To calculate this, you will need to add up the monthly feesthat will be payable during this period, taking account of any months where only a proportion of the monthly fee is payable.</p>
<h5><strong>General Information</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>
<p>If you buy insurance in the United Kingdom, you can <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">choose which law to apply to your policy. Unless you and the insurer make a written agreement saying otherwise before the policy is issued, the law of England and Wales will apply to this insurance. Unless otherwise agreed the contractual terms of this policy, all prior information and all communications will be in English.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Disclosure (in relation to insurance cover provided as part of the Barclays Pack(s) range)</strong></h5>
<p>You are responsible for providing complete and <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">accurate information to insurers when you take out your insurance policy, and throughout the life of your policy. It is important that you ensure that all statements you make on claim forms and other documents are full and accurate. If you provide false or inaccurate information to us or your insurers, this could invalidate your insurance cover and could mean that part or all of the claim may not be paid.</span></p>

<h5><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>1.      Introduction</strong></h5>
<p>1.1  In this introduction, We have set out the conditions which deal with the features of the Scheme that We would particularly like to bring to Your attention. Please read all of the Terms and Conditions carefully because We will rely on all of them in Our dealings with You.</p>
<p>1.2  The Scheme applies to participating airport lounges, restaurants, spas and nail bars and access to the benefits and facilities is at all times subject to availability. We reserve the right to include and withdraw airport lounges, restaurants, spas and nail bars from the Scheme entirely at Our discretion and without notice. We cannot accept any liability in the event that an airport lounge, restaurant, spa or nail bar is full or already reserved/allocated and can’t provide You with access unless You have pre-booked.</p>
<p>1.3  To gain access to participating Airport Services available under the Scheme, You must show Your passport and/or boarding pass with Your valid membership card. To redeem discounts, vouchers and offers, You will need to show the code generated by the App or Website (QR Code)</p>
<p>1.4  The number of guests permitted varies from lounge to lounge, as does the policy regarding access for children. Please check the App, Website or call Us, prior to travelling, on <strong>0333 220 5599</strong>* for information on the individual lounges You plan to use, to determine their policy on guests and children.</p>
<p>1.5  At busy times airport lounges may be at their full capacity and unable to accept more guests. Some lounges also reserve and/or pre-allocate a limited amount of space for pre-booked entry, this means that unless You have pre-booked the lounge for £5 per person, per visit, and arrive at the correct time, You may be refused access on the basis of a lack of capacity even if the lounge doesn’t look full. Neither We, nor DragonPass have any control over the decision of individual airport lounges whether to admit any individual. Please refer to section 4 (Lounge Access &amp; Pre-Booking), paragraph 4.8, for more information regarding admission for pre-bookings.</p>
<p>1.6  If You or any member of Your party has any medical conditions or disability which may affect Your access to an airport lounge, We recommend that You check with the individual lounge, prior to travelling, to see whether they can facilitate any special requirements You may have. We regret that We can’t accept liability in the event an airport lounge is unable to facilitate special requirements.</p>
<p>1.7  We’ll notify You of any changes to Your Free Passes, that You receive per renewal year, or any of these Terms and Conditions by Your preferred communication (by post or Your available digital channel) 30 days before they become effective.</p>

<h5><strong>4.      Airport Lounge Access &amp; Pre-Booking</strong></h5>
<p>4.1  Participating airport lounge staff will record Your details and communicate them to DragonPass. This information will be used for record keeping, tracking usage and billing purposes, where appropriate.</p>
<p>4.2  Please note that any food and drink, including alcoholic drinks, provided as part of Your airport lounge visit are only for consumption in the airport lounge and are not to be taken out of the lounge. We recommend that You contact the individual lounge in advance of Your travel if You or any member of Your party has any dietary requirements.</p>
<p>4.3  It’s Your responsibility to ensure You and Your guests arrive at the departure gate on time and board Your flight in good time. There is no obligation on the lounges to provide flight information or announcements.</p>
<p>4.4  Certain airport lounges can be pre-booked for a cost of £5 per person per visit via the DragonPass Premier+ App or the <strong>barclays.dragonpasspremierplus.com</strong> Website.</p>
<p>4.5  To check if the airport lounge You intend to visit can be pre-booked in advance, please check the App or the Website, where You’ll be able to select the lounge that You intend to use and check if pre-booking is available at Your desired time of travel.</p>
<p>4.6  If You wish to pre-book Your Lounge access, You must do so at least 72 hours before You intend to visit.  Some lounges will allow You to book with 48 hours’ notice, so it is important to check the text underneath the “Date &amp; Time” section to see whether it is possible first. To pre-book just visit Our Website or App, follow the steps online and the selected number of passes and the fees will be removed from Your account at the time of making the booking.</p>
<p>4.7  If You need to amend Your pre-booking details, You must give at least 72 hours’ notice. However, as with making a pre-booking, in 4.6, some lounges will allow you to amend with at least 48 hours’ notice, so it is important to check the text under “Important Notes” on Your booking confirmation email or within the ‘Bookings’ section of App or Website. In order to amend your booking You must contact Our Customer Service Team via email at <a href="mailto:support@dragonpasspremierplus.com"><strong>support@dragonpasspremierplus.com </strong></a>or, on <strong>0333 220 5599</strong>* and they’ll be able to do this once for You. If further changes are needed, it must be cancelled and re-booked. Please note, amendments cannot always be guaranteed due to availability of the lounge, and therefore, We will always try to do Our best and amend where possible.</p>
<p>4.8  If You need to cancel Your booking entirely, You can do this either using the App, visiting Our Website, contacting us via email <a href="mailto:support@dragonpasspremierplus.com"><strong>support@dragonpasspremierplus.com</strong>,</a> or on <strong>0333 220 5599</strong>*. As long as You cancel any pre-bookings no later than 48 hours before the intend visit time. Once cancelled, Your Free Pass(es) or any purchased additional Pass(es) will be credited back to Your account and the booking fee will be refunded into the account where payment was taken. Please ensure You read the text under “Important Notes” on Your booking confirmation email or within the ‘Bookings’ section of App or Website to ensure that cancellations are possible for the lounge You have pre-booked. For cancellations made with less than 48 hours’ notice, clause 4.10 below will apply.</p>
<p>4.9  There may be times where a lounge may need to cancel Your booking for unforeseen circumstances. For example, closures for refurbishments. In this event and once cancelled, Your Free Pass(es) or any purchased Additional Pass(es) will be credited back to Your account, and the booking fee will be refunded into the account where payment was taken. We will make every effort to notify You as far in advance as possible of your booking but cannot guarantee when this would be, due to information being provided by Third-Party Organisations under the Scheme. Neither We, nor DragonPass, accept liability and would not provide further compensation in this circumstance.</p>
<p>4.10  When arriving at the airport lounge it’s important that You arrive on time; if You arrive later than the pre-booked time then it will be at the discretion of the lounge as to whether they can still allow You access and for how long.</p>
<p>4.11  If You don’t attend the lounge, are refused access to the lounge because You have arrived later than Your pre-booked time or You cancel Your pre-booking less than 72 hours (48 hours for some lounges) in advance of the visit, You will not receive a refund of Your pre-booking fee and You’ll be deemed to have used Your Free Pass(es). Where You’ve purchased Additional Passes over and above Your annual allowance and pre-booked that visit, neither Your Additional Passes fee nor Your pre-booking fee will be refunded.</p>
<p>4.12  Facilities and amenities in lounges will vary, and at certain times may be limited. Neither We nor DragonPass have any responsibility and are not able to control the provision of facilities within individual lounges. If You require more information, please refer to the terms set by each individual lounge.</p>

<p>6.2  Each restaurant reserves the right to operate under their specific terms and conditions in terms of menu availability, dress code, behaviour, single sex party groups, total party size and food/drink exclusions.</p>

<h5><strong>7       Restaurant Vouchers</strong></h5>
<p>7.1  Members can download restaurant vouchers via the App or the Website. These vouchers will use up 1 Pass (Free or Additional) per redemption and can be redeemed against food and beverages in participating airport restaurants. The redemption value applicable (£15 or $20 USD) and any restrictions on how the redemption value may be applied can be found under the “Restaurant Details” section on the App and the Website. However, what it may be redeemed against will vary depending on the participating restaurant.</p>
<p>7.2  The voucher must be presented before You place Your order as well as prior to paying the bill, either the digital version available from the App or the Website or a printed copy.</p>
<p>7.3  Each restaurant voucher will deduct one of Your Passes from Your annual membership allowance once redeemed.</p>
<p>7.4  Restaurant vouchers can only be used by a member and are non-transferable and non-refundable. Only one voucher can be used per transaction/bill. For example, if you have a joint account or are travelling with another member on the scheme, then both members can redeem a voucher. However, this would need to be done against two separate bills and have their respective voucher applied to their own bill.</p>
<p>7.5  Restaurant vouchers have a usage limit to one voucher every 5 hours regardless of the restaurant type.</p>
<p>7.6  Should the purchase total come to less than the value of the redemption voucher then no change will be given. Should the total be more than the voucher value then the member will be liable to pay the difference. Vouchers have no equivalent cash value and cannot be exchanged for cash.</p>
<p>7.7  The voucher cannot be used in conjunction with any other offers, entitlements, discounts, vouchers or promotions. Redemption of the voucher is subject to availability and does not guarantee access, table reservations or bookings at a participating restaurant. Access to the restaurant is at the restaurant’s sole discretion. We shall not be held liable if Your chosen restaurant is unavailable.</p>
<p>7.8  To view a list of participating restaurants please visit the App or the Website. Where a restaurant offers a voucher, the App and Website will display the value amount off (e.g. £15 off). Participating restaurants are subject to change without notice so please check before You travel.</p>

<h3><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong><br />
</h3>
<p>The concierge service is owned and operated by Ten Lifestyle Management Limited (“Ten”, “us”, “our”). Ten is a lifestyle concierge company registered in England and Wales (CRN: 4688658) whose registered address is 2nd Floor, Fitzroy House, 355 Euston Road, London NW1 3AL.<br />
</p>
<p>Ten is owned by Ten Lifestyle Group Plc, a publicly listed company on the London Stock Exchange ('TENG').</p>
<p>Ten provides concierge services (the “Concierge Service”) to eligible individuals on behalf of its client Barclays (the “Service Provider”), collectively and individually known as “Members” or “you”.</p>
<p>The Concierge Service is provided primarily through personalised advice and bookings received via phone or email and procuring goods and services provided by third party suppliers (“Suppliers”).</p>
<p>The following terms and conditions (the “Terms”) govern your use of our website(s) (the “Site”) and our provision of Concierge Services to Members.</p>
<h4><strong>1.  Our Contract</strong></h4>
<p>1.1 Please read these Terms carefully before using the Site or the Concierge Service. For the purposes of these Terms:</p>
<p>a) individuals eligible to receive the Concierge Service as per instruction from the Service Provider are known as the “Lead User”;</p>
<p>b) each individual that the Lead User grants permission to use the service on their behalf is an “Authorised User” (the Service Provider will determine the limit on the number of Authorised Users per Lead User);</p>
<p>c) Lead Users and Authorised Users are each known as “Members”;</p>
<p>d) all Members must be at least 18 years of age and possess the legal authority to enter into this agreement;</p>
<p>e) all information provided by Members to us, the Service Provider or the Suppliers should be true and accurate;</p>
<p>f) when visiting or using the Site or the Concierge Service and/or any content or materials available from us, you agree to be bound by these Terms which shall form a legally binding agreement between you and us. </p>
<p>g) You’ve also read, understood and accepted the Privacy Statement; and </p>
<p>h) we reserve the right to update or change these Terms from time to time at our discretion with 30 days notice, and your continued use of the Site or the Concierge Service will be subject to the then current version of these Terms. We recommend that you read the current version of these Terms each time before you use the Concierge Service. </p>
<h4><strong>2. Our Services</strong><br />
</h4>
<p>2.1 The Concierge Service we provide by phone and email includes the ability to:</p>
<p>a) place a new request with the Concierge Service;</p>
<p>b) book services and order goods with Suppliers (“Services”); and </p>
<p>c) request to be updated on specific information.</p>
<p>2.2 The Concierge Service we provide via the Site also includes:<br />
</p>
<p>a) access to articles and other content we publish on our Site;</p>
<p>b) the ability to search for Suppliers and where applicable book services and order goods with said Suppliers (also “Services”); and </p>
<p>c) such other services as we elect to provide from the Site from time to time.</p>
<p>2.3 If you use one of the phone numbers provided to you or published on a Site to call and speak to one of our representative’s (a “Lifestyle Manager”), please note that telephone calls to us will be monitored for training and quality purposes.<br />
</p>
<p>2.4 We reserve the right at any time to modify the Concierge Service we provide to you and to add or remove content, or we can close your Pack for the reasons set out in the Barclays Pack terms and conditions.</p>
<p>2.5 Unless otherwise stated in writing by us and with the exception of some travel bookings (see section 6 and the Travel Policy of these Terms), when you make a request for goods or services from a Supplier through the Concierge Service you’ll enter into a contract directly with the Supplier for the provision of the goods or services and you’ll be bound by the Supplier’s terms and conditions (including but not limited to their cancellation and/or return terms). In these circumstances, it is very important for you to review any applicable terms and conditions before you complete the transaction.</p>
<p>2.6 Where there’s specific terms and conditions between us and you for types of Services provided via the Site or by email or phone, these are outlined below.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Dining</strong><br />
</h4>
<p>3.1 Ten works with third party restaurant and dining Suppliers to offer exclusive and non-exclusive bookings, special benefits and offers to Members as part of the Concierge Service.</p>
<p>3.2 You accept that special benefits and offers with Suppliers are subject to availability and may change from time to time and without notice. It’s important to note that not all of the Services made available or provided on the Site are available in all jurisdictions.</p>
<p>3.3 We reserve the right to deny restaurant reservation requests from you if you repeatedly fail to show up for bookings or violate any Supplier’s terms and conditions including their cancellation terms.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Tickets</strong><br />
</h4>
<p>4.1 Ten works with third party ticketing and event Suppliers to quote details of face value tickets, hospitality tickets and tickets from secondary market agents to Members as part of the Concierge Service.</p>
<p>4.2 All tickets are subject to availability.</p>
<p>4.3 If you decide to order tickets from a Supplier quoted by us, you authorise us to arrange for payment of tickets on your behalf. Once you’ve given us authorisation to purchase tickets with the Supplier on your behalf, you’ll be liable to pay the full price for the tickets. Once the purchase is confirmed, no refunds or exchanges will be available, unless stated otherwise in the Supplier terms and conditions.</p>
<p>4.4 You’ll enter into a contract for the sale and/or supply of the tickets with the relevant Supplier. Ten or the Service Provider won’t be party to this contract. </p>
<p>4.5 You should ensure that you check both the booking confirmation and the tickets you receive and notify us immediately if any details are incorrect or there are any discrepancies. Where an error has been made by us, we’ll endeavour to resolve the error with the appropriate level of cost and/or compensation. In all other cases, we’ll endeavour to assist you with correcting the error without incurring any financial liability. </p>
<p>4.6 We’ll endeavour to advise you if any tickets have a restricted view prior to your purchase. Tickets will be considered restricted view only if specified by the Supplier, box office, venue and/or on the physical tickets. </p>
<p>4.7 The Supplier, together with us, will select the method and company used for ticket delivery. Often tickets will be sent via secure post or courier which will require a signature upon delivery. When delivery is attempted, if you’re unavailable you’ll need to collect from the local sorting office or, where appropriate, organise a re-delivery directly with the courier company. We’ll offer support with any deliveries but won’t be held liable for errors not caused by us.</p>
<p>4.8 Tickets are usually delivered between 5 to 7 days before the date of the event, with the exception of theatre tickets, which are sent after the booking is made. The date upon which tickets are released is controlled by the promoters of the event (and not us), who often delay delivery in order to reduce both fraudulent activity and the risk of tickets being misplaced.</p>
<p>4.9 When tickets are purchased through secondary ticket agents, the Supplier will make every effort to deliver them several days before the event. However, they reserve the right to deliver tickets up to 24 hours in advance and on rare occasions may arrange for you to meet a representative at the venue.</p>
<p>4.10 It’s your responsibility to advise us of any change of address which may affect your booking, or if you plan to be away in the days leading up to the event.</p>
<p>4.11 If tickets are misplaced and originally purchased through a face value box office, tickets can often be duplicated. It’s unlikely that tickets will be re-issued prior to the event date and will therefore need to be collected from the box office. In order to collect tickets in this way, the cardholder and the card that was used to purchase the tickets need to be present. Letters of authorisation are subject to the venue box office’s discretion and in some instances, may not be accepted.</p>
<p>4.12 If tickets purchased through secondary ticket agents are misplaced, it’s extremely difficult to arrange duplicates or box office collection, since they usually need to be collected by the individual who originally purchased the tickets. If this occurs, we’ll endeavour to arrange for duplicates or collection, but if we’re unable to do so we can’t provide a refund.</p>
<p>4.13 If you find you’re unable to attend an event and would like advice on re-selling your tickets, please contact us for further information.</p>
<p>4.14 While we’ll endeavour to update you if we become aware of any changes made to the date or time of your event, we can’t take responsibility to inform you if an event is cancelled or to provide details if it is rearranged by the event promoter. Where tickets are purchased through the secondary market, tickets will usually be valid for the rescheduled date. If you’re not able to make the new date, refunds are at the relevant Supplier’s discretion. We’re not responsible for any additional financial outlay, such as for accommodation or transport, that occurs as a result of a cancelled or rescheduled date.</p>
<p>4.15 For tickets purchased direct through the box office, if the event is cancelled, you’ll receive a full refund direct from the box office. If the event is postponed, refunds will not be given until a new date has been rescheduled. If you can’t attend the new date, then you’re normally entitled to a full refund.</p>
<p>4.16 Please ensure you check your debit or credit card statement to confirm that your card has been charged for the amount of your tickets within 3 to 5 days of booking. If this isn’t the case then please call your Lifestyle Manager.</p>
<p>4.17 In the unusual event that a Supplier (box office or secondary market ticket supplier) goes insolvent, bankrupt or doesn’t deliver the tickets, we can’t accept liability for the loss of tickets. The relevant terms and conditions between you and the Supplier will apply. We’ll offer assistance and act on behalf of the Member to endeavour to remedy the situation. As a minimum, this will include:</p>
<p>a) advising the Member of the chargeback process, if they’ve paid by debit or credit card, whereby Visa / MasterCard / Amex go to the vendor to try to re-coup the money. Note there’s a time limit within which this chargeback process is applicable; and / or </p>
<p>b) if the Member chooses to purchase new tickets, sourcing alternative tickets to match the original order as closely as possible in terms of location, price and date. </p>
<h4><strong>5. Events and Benefits</strong><br />
</h4>
<p>5.1 Ten works with Suppliers to share details of events and/or benefits to Members as part of the Concierge Service.</p>
<p>5.2 Benefits are subject to availability.</p>
<p>5.3 Benefits may be withdrawn at any time and without prior notice.</p>
<h4><strong>6. Travel </strong><br />
</h4>
<p>6.1 We may engage certain local travel agencies to act solely in the capacity of agent for Suppliers of air, hotel, car and other travel-related products and services (&quot;Travel Suppliers&quot;) to provide Members with the ability to purchase airline tickets, hotel accommodation, car rentals and other travel-related products and services (“Travel Services”) in accordance with the Travel Policy to these Terms, which includes our cancellation policy. </p>
<h4><strong>7. Fair Usage Policy</strong><br />
</h4>
<p>7.1 You must make sure that any use of the Concierge Service complies with these Terms. </p>
<p>7.2 There’s no specified limit on the usage of our Concierge Service. However, if we feel that your activities are so excessive that other members are detrimentally affected, we may give you a written notice (by email or otherwise) or limit the number of requests you can submit in a given time period. In extreme circumstances, if the levels of activity don’t promptly decrease after the warning, we may terminate or suspend your account after prior consultation with the Service Provider.</p>
<p>7.3 If you breach these Terms, we may: (a) give you a notice to stop or moderate the unacceptable use(s); or (b) terminate or suspend your Concierge Service, with or without notice as we consider appropriate, under the Terms.</p>
<p>7.4 You are responsible for all use of the Concierge Service through your pack and for any breach of these Terms whether an unacceptable use occurs or is attempted, whether you knew or should’ve known about it, whether or not you carried out or attempted the unacceptable use alone, contributed to or acted with others or allowed any unacceptable use to occur by omission.</p>
<h4><strong>8. Complaints</strong><br />
</h4>
<p>8.1 Please contact us immediately should you be dissatisfied with any aspect of the Concierge Service you receive and we’ll use reasonable endeavours to look into the issue within two working days of receipt of your notification and to respond to you as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>8.2 Ten or the Service Provider aren’t responsible for the failure of any Supplier to provide any Services or the negligence of the Supplier providing them. However, we’ll endeavour to assist you in the resolution of any such issue.</p>

<p>–    if we’re under a duty to or permitted to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations, or in order to enforce or apply this Privacy Statement and other agreements; or to allow a Supplier to enforce or apply its contract with you.

<h4><strong>5. Where we store your data</strong><br />
</h4>
<ul>
<li>In order to perform the Concierge Service, allow you to receive the Services from Suppliers or work with Barclays in relation to the Concierge Service, we may need to transfer your personal data outside of your country to countries where Ten has an office or to countries where a Supplier is needed to fulfil a request for you. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country where you initially provided the information. When we transfer or disclose your information, we’ll protect that information as described in this Privacy Statement.  </li>
<li>Where we transfer your personal data outside of the country in which you’re based, we’ll rely on appropriate safeguards to cover transfers of your personal data including, for example, signing standard contractual clauses/data protection clauses adopted by the UK Secretary of State or European Commission, or applicable data protection laws in your country. Such transfers will always take place in compliance with the applicable data protection laws. </li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>6. Retention of your data</strong><br />
</h4>
<ul>
<li>We take appropriate measures to ensure that any personal data is kept secure. We’ll store your personal data for the duration of your use of our Site or the Concierge Service. Thereafter your data may be shared with Barclays, and / or any third party as instructed by Barclays, for the continuation of the Concierge Service.</li>
<li>If you delete your account, we will continue to store your personal data for a period of time in line with legal, regulatory, financial and business requirements. This is normally 5 years. We also keep a record of correspondence in line with legal, regulatory, financial and business requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>7. Access to your data and your rights</strong><br />
</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a result of us collecting and processing your information, you may have the following legal rights subject to the data protection laws in your country</li>
</ul>
<p>–    to access personal data held about you;</p>
<p>–    to request us to make any changes to your personal data if it is inaccurate or incomplete;</p>
<p>–    to request your personal data is erased where we do not have a compelling reason to continue to process such data in certain circumstances;</p>
<p>–    to receive your personal data provided to us as a data controller in a usable way in certain circumstances;</p>
<p>–    to object to, or restrict, our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances;</p>
<p>–    where our processing of your personal data is based on your consent you have the right to withdraw consent at any time by contacting us; and</p>
<p>–    to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority. If you have any concerns regarding our processing of your personal data, or are not satisfied with our handling of any request made by you in relation to your rights, you may make a complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office (information on how to do this can be found at ico.org.uk/concerns). </p>
<ul>
<li>Rights in relation to automatic decision making do not apply as we do not carry out automatic decision making. </li>
<li>To exercise any of your rights as set out above, please contact Ten’s Data Protection Officer, Ten Lifestyle Group, Fitzroy House, 355 Euston Road, London NW1 3AL or email or phone the Concierge Service and ask to be transferred to our Data Protection Officer.</li>
