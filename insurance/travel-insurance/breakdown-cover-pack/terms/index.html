            <p>Enjoy complete peace of mind while you’re driving with RAC UK Roadside and At Home Breakdown Cover. All for £9.00 a month.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to save the phone number below in your mobile phone so it’s always handy, when you need it. You can also download the RAC app – so you can access the services anytime, anywhere. You do not need to input any details to access the RAC app’s services.<br />
</p>
<p>The RAC will assist you if you break down at the roadside or at home, so whether you’re already on the road, on the way to work or an important appointment or about to set off on the school run you’re covered.<br />
</p>
<p>You’re also covered if you’re a driver or a passenger in any vehicle and there are no hidden charges, labour and fitting costs at the roadside or at home are all included.<br />
</p>
<p>RAC patrols fix 4 out of 5 vehicles on average within 30 minutes of arriving, however if the problem can’t be solved at the roadside or at home, your vehicle will be towed up to 10 miles to a location of your choice.<br />

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>If you have a Barclays current account</th>
</tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td><p>You can apply for a Pack through Online Banking, the Barclays app or visiting a <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">branch.</span></p>
<p>These terms cover your Pack. If there’s inconsistency between these and the Retail Customer Agreement, these terms take priority in relation to the Packs.</p>
<p>Each of the benefits and services in the Packs are provided to you under a separate agreement with the provider of the relevant benefits or services and the provider is responsible for providing the relevant benefits and services to you. The provider may be a company within the Barclays group of companies or by a company outside that group.</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>A Pack is a set of services (such as insurance) available to any eligible person aged 18+ for a monthly fee. You can only purchase a Pack and claim the benefits included in it if you are a UK resident.</p>
<h3>Eligibility for Pack benefits</h3>
<p>Before choosing a Pack, you should check that you are eligible for the benefits under each policy or feature. We will provide information and ask you questions to help you do this. For instance, you may not be eligible to claim for certain benefits because of your age or you have a pre-existing medical condition.</p>
<h3>What you pay</h3>
<p>You pay a monthly fee in advance for each Pack purchased, as set out in the ‘Statement of Price’ within the About Our Insurance Services section. The Pack fee includes Insurance Premium Tax at the current rate. The monthly fee is the cost of the Pack as a whole. No part of any Pack fee is attributable to any particular benefit or service in your Pack. You will not be entitled to a refund or reduction in the Pack fee if you choose not to use a benefit or service, you’re not eligible for a benefit or service, or it’s not otherwise available to you. You must have a Pack for a minimum term of six months from the date you purchase the Pack (unless we say otherwise in these terms) after which you can close the Pack at any time.</p>
<p>You may be able to add additional features to the services included in a Pack and we’ll tell you what these cost before you choose to add them.</p>
<p>By agreeing to these terms and conditions you provide Barclays authority to:</p>
<p>(i) debit a part payment of the monthly Pack fee to cover the period from the date on which you purchase the Pack, up to the last day of that month; and thereafter<br />
(ii) debit the monthly Pack fee.<br />
(iii) apply a change in the monthly Pack fee subject to the appropriate notice period</p>
<p>All payments will be taken in advance from your Barclays current account on the first working day of the month on an ongoing basis until your Pack is cancelled. You must ensure you have sufficient credit funds in your Barclays current account to cover the monthly Pack fee, otherwise you may incur borrowing charges in line with any arrangement you have with us.</p>
<h3>Duration and Minimum Term</h3>
<p>Unless you cancel within the 14-day cooling off period, you must hold this Pack for a minimum term of six months from it being opened, after which the Pack will automatically renew on a monthly basis and after which you can cancel the Pack at any time. There are some exceptions to this. For more information please refer to the Minimum Term below.</p>
<p>To cancel, contact us on 0345 7 345 345, visit your nearest Barclays Branch or tell us by writing to <strong>Barclays, Leicester LE87 2BB</strong>.</p>
<h3>Keeping each other informed</h3>
<p>We need you to tell us about changes to your situation or personal details, and we’ll keep you informed about certain things that affect you. Information will only be sent to you, the Pack holder.</p>
<h4>How we contact you</h4>
<p>We’ll contact you, the Pack holder, using the details you have given to us. This may include using your landline phone, mobile, email or home address. If you have a Barclays current account, we may also contact you through Online Banking or the Barclays app if you use these.</p>
<p>You can tell us how you want us to contact you, for example by post or your available digital channel. Where we can, we’ll contact you using your preferred method. We may not always be able to do this – for example, sometimes the law may require us to send you something by post. If we send information to you at the most recent postal address you have given us and it’s returned to us as undelivered, we’ll stop using that address unless we are required by law or regulation to send you information.</p>
<p>If you have not told us how you’d prefer us to communicate, then we’ll normally contact you by email. If we send you information through Barclays Online Banking, we’ll text you or send you an email or other electronic message reminding you to view any new message we’ve posted. Where we do this, we won’t normally send documents to your home address as well (unless we have to or you have asked us to).</p>
<p>Once we’ve sent a message to you, we’ll assume you have received it. So it’s important to look out for notifications like emails or texts from us.</p>
<p>We are always working to make our services more convenient and flexible so we may introduce new ways of communicating with you in the future.</p>
<h4>Help us to keep your information private</h4>
<p>It’s your responsibility to control who reads your information. When you choose how you would like us to contact you, you should choose a method that will be most secure for you. If you use a method that other people can access or read (such as a shared email address or shared mobile number), please be aware that these people will also be able to access the information we send you.</p>
<h4>Keeping your details up to date</h4>
<p>When we send information to you, we’ll send it to the most recent contact details we have for you. If these details change and you don’t tell us straight away, you may not receive information that could be important – or it could fall into the wrong hands. If you have given us contact details (even if you think we don’t use some of them, such as your mobile phone number), you must let us know if they change. This will include your:</p>
<ul>
<li>home address</li>
<li>email address</li>
<li>landline phone number</li>
<li>mobile phone number.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s very important that you also keep us informed if there are any changes to your situation, personal details or any other important changes that are relevant to us – for example, if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>change your name</li>
<li>move to another country and are no longer a UK resident.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t keep all your details up to date, this might affect your eligibility for Pack(s), or how they work. This is also so we can continue to manage your Pack(s), and communicate with you including notifying you of changes. We also respect your privacy and we don’t want to send you unwanted information.</p>
<p>If you wish to change the Nominated Person named on the Pack(s) we’ll close your Pack(s) to do this before opening a new Pack(s). The minimum term will re-start upon the purchase of a new Pack(s).</p>
<h4>Contacting us</h4>
<p>You can always contact us through your available digital channel, or other electronic methods we tell you about. You can also contact us by telephone using the details we give you, by visiting a branch or by post. We’ll let you know if our details change.</p>
<p>You can contact us by any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into the Barclays app and select the ‘call us’ feature</li>
<li>By telephone on <strong>0800 158 3199</strong></li>
<li>Visit your local branch</li>
<li>In writing to <strong>Barclays, Leicester LE87 2BB</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Closing your Pack</h3>
<p>Whilst we’d be very sorry to lose you, you can close your Pack within the 14-day cooling-off period, which starts the day your Pack is purchased or you receive your Welcome Pack, whichever is later. If you close your Pack within this period and have paid your first monthly Pack fee, it will be refunded. You can also cancel or close your Pack at any time after the minimum term explained below has ended. If we need to close your Pack, we’ll follow the process set out below.</p>
<h4>Minimum Term</h4>
<p>You must have a Pack for a minimum term of six months from the date you open the Pack, after which the Pack will automatically renew on a monthly basis and after which you can close the Pack at any time. There are some exceptions to this minimum term requirement. You may close your Pack:</p>
<ul>
<li>within the 14-day cooling-off period as set out above</li>
<li>if you experience financial hardship due to a significant change in personal circumstances, for example, you’re declared bankrupt</li>
<li>if you’re no longer resident in the UK</li>
<li>after we have notified you of an unfavourable change to the terms of the Pack you hold, such as an increase in price or a change in what the Pack provides (provided that you do so before the change takes effect)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you tell us you want to close your Pack, closure will take effect on the day that we receive notice from you (so the insurance and your right to receive any of the other services within the Pack will end on the date we receive your notice). You will receive a part refund for the remaining number of days in that month, including the day we receive your notice. You won’t be able to use any benefits or services linked to it any more although you can still make a claim for an event which occurred whilst you were insured.</p>
<p>We will not let you re-select the same Pack for 12 months if you cancel it within the minimum term, or your Barclays current account is closed by Barclays Financial Assistance or if you do not comply with these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>You are unable to cancel individual insurance Pack products, only the whole Pack.</p>
<p>You can cancel your Pack within the Barclays app, Online Banking, by calling us, visiting a branch or by writing to <strong>Barclays, Leicester LE87 2BB</strong>.</p>
<h4>When we can close a Pack</h4>
<p>We can close a Pack by giving you at least 30 calendar days’ notice. This also applies during the minimum term. However, we may close your Pack immediately or on less notice if we reasonably believe you have seriously or persistently broken any terms of the agreement or we reasonably believe any of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>you put us in a position where we might break a law, regulation, code or other duty that applies to us if we maintain your Pack</li>
<li>you give us any false or inaccurate information at any time</li>
<li>you commit (or attempt) fraud against us or someone else</li>
<li>you behave in a threatening or abusive manner to our staff</li>
<li>you become bankrupt</li>
<li>your Barclays current account is closed by Barclays Financial Assistance</li>
</ul>
<p>The insurer may also cancel the insurance policies within Breakdown Cover Pack as set out in the terms and conditions of the policy document.</p>
<h4>Using the Current Account Switch Service</h4>
<p>If you decide to switch your current account from us by using the Current Account Switch Service, your Pack will be closed on the same day that your Current Account is closed.</p>
<h3>Changes we can make to this agreement</h3>
<p>Sometimes we’ll want or need to change things, such as charges or terms of our agreement. For most changes, we’ll tell you in advance, but we don’t always need to do this.</p>
<p>We review the Packs from time to time and may make changes to them, including the benefits and services included in a Pack or the providers of these or the monthly Pack fee. We may also make changes to the terms on which each benefit is provided (such as changes to the terms of an individual policy). We’ll give you 30 calendar days’ notice before any changes apply.</p>
<p>If we make changes to a Pack, we will provide information about you to any new provider to make sure there is no interruption in the benefit or service you receive. The new provider will use your information to provide you with the benefits and services.</p>
<h4>Changes we need to tell you about in advance</h4>
<p>We may make changes to your agreement with us because:</p>
<ul>
<li>we’re changing a service we already offer, or introducing a new service that needs a change to the terms of this agreement, such as introducing a new charge</li>
<li>we’re changing the agreement to be in line with the banking industry and our competitors</li>
<li>we’re withdrawing a service or type of Pack</li>
<li>we’re moving you from one type of Pack to another for a good reason – examples of this include where we’re withdrawing a Pack</li>
<li>we need to make changes to take account of developments (or changes we reasonably expect to help) in technology (including the systems we use to run our business), or in the banking system generally</li>
<li>our agreement or the Pack is affected by a change in the law or regulation (including industry codes we follow) or decisions of the Financial Ombudsman, a regulator or court</li>
<li>changes in our costs (including changes we reasonably expect to happen) mean we need to change or introduce charges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because you may have your Pack with us for many years, we need the flexibility to manage our business long term, including providing a sufficient financial return for us to operate our business in a prudent and sustainable manner. We can’t predict everything that may affect our business, so there may be other reasons we have not set out above when we need to make a change. But please be assured we’ll only make changes we think are fair and will give you 30 calendar days’ notice of the change unless we are prevented from doing so by law or regulation, or the change is in your favour.</p>
<p>If we give you notice as set out above and you don’t tell us you want to close your Pack, then we’ll treat you as having accepted the change. If you don’t want to accept the change and want to end this agreement and close the Pack, you must tell us before the proposed change applies.</p>
<h4>Changes we don’t need to tell you about in advance</h4>
<p>We don’t have to tell you about changes to these terms and conditions (or changes in the insurer terms and conditions) in advance when any of the following happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the change is in your favour</li>
<li>we make a change because a change in law or regulation says that we have to by a particular date, and there isn’t time to give you notice.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructions for your Pack(s)</h4>
<p>We will only accept instructions from the Pack holder about the Pack (including to change your contact preferences and to apply for new Packs, products and services).</p>
<p>Your Nominated Person will be able to make a claim for the Pack benefits or services. They cannot provide any other instructions in relation to the Pack.</p>
<h4>If you think your security has been compromised</h4>
<p>If you think someone (except someone you have asked to provide Pack information) has used or is able to use any of the means of access to your Pack, you must tell us as soon as you can by using the contact details shown in the ‘Unauthorised access to your Pack?’ section.</p>
<p>If you have a Barclays current account, we can arrange to temporarily suspend access to a service (such as Telephone Banking) to prevent anyone misusing your Pack(s).</p>
<p>You must give us any information we ask for about what has happened. We’ll pass this to the police if we have to, or if we think that will be useful.</p>

<h3>Complaints and the protection you have</h3>
<h4>If you have a complaint</h4>

<p>Your feedback gives us the opportunity to put matters right and improve our service to all our customers. A leaflet detailing how we deal with complaints is available on request in our branches, from the Barclays Information Line on <strong>03457 345 345*</strong> or at <strong>barclays.co.uk</strong>.</p>

<p>Nothing in these terms, including referral to the Financial Ombudsman Service, affects your statutory rights.</p>
<h3>Using information about you</h3>
<p>Barclays is committed to protecting your personal data. We will use your information for a number of different purposes, for example, to manage your Pack(s), to provide our products and services to you and others and to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. We may also share your information with our trusted 3rd parties for these purposes. For more detailed information on how and why we use your information, including the rights in relation to your personal data, and our legal grounds for using it, please go to <strong>barclays.co.uk/control-your-data</strong> or you can request a copy from us.</p>
<h4>Credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</h4>
<p>In order to process your application, we will supply your personal information to credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies and they will give us information about you, such as about your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and record debts and prevent criminal activity. These agencies may in turn share your personal information with other organisations. If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services, finance or employment.</p>
<p>Once you open a Pack with us, we will share pack data with the credit reference agencies on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>If false or inaccurate information is provided to us and fraud is identified, details may be passed to credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering and to verify your identity.</p>
<p>The Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN) describes how the three main credit reference agencies in the UK each use and share personal data. The CRAIN is available on the credit reference agencies websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.transunion.co.uk/crain" title="transunion.co.uk/crain" target="_blank"><strong>transunion.co.uk/crain</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.equifax.co.uk/crain" title="equifax.co.uk/crain" target="_blank"><strong>equifax.co.uk/crain</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.experian.co.uk/crain" title="experian.co.uk/crain" target="_blank"><strong>experian.co.uk/crain</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Or you can ask us for a copy of these.</p>
<p>For more details on how information held by credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies may be used, please go to <strong><a href="https://www.barclays.co.uk/important-information/control-your-data/" target="_self">barclays.co.uk/control-your-data</a></strong> or you can request a copy from us.</p>

<li>This policy offers services for the <strong>breakdown</strong> of <strong>vehicles</strong>. It meets the demands and needs of those who wish to ensure the risk of <strong>breakdown</strong> is met now and in the future.</li>
<li>All requests for service must be made to <strong>us</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Your</strong> policy covers <strong>you</strong> in any <strong>vehicle</strong>. <strong>You</strong> can be a driver or <strong>passenger</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How long am I covered for and how many claims can I make?</h4>
<p>This <strong>breakdown</strong> policy is a part of the <strong>Breakdown Cover Pack</strong>. <strong>You</strong> are covered while <strong>your Breakdown Cover Pack</strong> is active. The initial policy term of this insurance is 6 months, after which it will automatically renew on a monthly basis until your Breakdown Cover Pack is closed, you fail to pay the monthly Breakdown Cover Pack fee, or your permanent residential address is no longer in the United Kingdom. There is no limit on the number of <strong>claims you</strong> can make.</p>
<h4>What vehicles am I covered in?</h4>
<p>Only vehicles that are privately owned or leased and used only for private use are covered. This means the vehicle should be registered in <strong>your</strong> name, or another individual and used for social, domestic, pleasure, and commuting to and from a permanent place of work only.</p>
<p>Cover is not provided for company cars or other <strong>vehicles</strong> used for business, even if you are not using it for business at the time. Business use includes hire and reward, delivery use and sign written vehicles.</p>
<h4>Caravans and trailers</h4>
<p>If <strong>your caravan</strong> or <strong>trailer breaks down</strong> in the <strong>UK</strong>, <strong>we</strong> will only send help to try and fix it at the roadside. This could be a permanent or temporary repair. <strong>We’ll </strong>only recover a <strong>caravan</strong> if it is attached to a <strong>broken-down vehicle</strong>.</p>

<p>RAC Motoring Services is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of regulated claims management activities.</p>
<h5>Urgent message relay</h5>
<p>If <strong>your vehicle</strong> has <strong>broken-down</strong> and <strong>you</strong> need to get in touch with friends and family urgently, <strong>we</strong> will get a message to them for <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<h5>Assistance in a medical emergency</h5>
<p>If <strong>you</strong> suddenly or unexpectedly fall ill or are injured, during a journey in the <strong>UK</strong> and no one within <strong>your</strong> party can drive the <strong>vehicle</strong>, <strong>we</strong> may be able to provide <strong>you</strong> assistance, such as taking your vehicle to a place of safety. This service is discretionary, and <strong>we</strong> will decide whether or not to provide this service. <strong>We</strong> will require written confirmation from the treating hospital or medical expert that <strong>you</strong> are unable to drive.</p>
<h4>Additional services</h4>
<p>If <strong>your vehicle</strong> cannot be driven for any reason other than a <strong>breakdown</strong> or<strong> road traffic collision</strong>, for example if <strong>you</strong> have a <strong>driver-induced fault</strong>, <strong>we</strong> will send help to the <strong>vehicle</strong>. If <strong>we</strong> cannot get <strong>you</strong> going again, <strong>we</strong> will recover the <strong>vehicle</strong> and <strong>passengers</strong> up to 10 miles. Any equipment or <strong>specialist resource</strong> required by <strong>us</strong> to repair or arrange the recovery of the <strong>vehicle</strong> will be chargeable.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> can also provide additional services that are not included in <strong>your policy</strong> but <strong>we</strong> will charge <strong>you</strong> for these, for example to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase the parts <strong>you</strong> need to get on <strong>your</strong> way;</li>
<li>Pay for <strong>specialist resource</strong> to complete the repairs; or</li>
<li>Arrange a second or extended recovery.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>We</strong> will agree these costs up front and will need full payment before <strong>we</strong> can help. <strong>You</strong> will be responsible for any additional charges. This is why <strong>we</strong> request proof of identity at the <strong>breakdown</strong>.</p>
<h4>General conditions</h4>
<p>These apply to all sections of this <strong>policy</strong>. If <strong>you</strong> do not meet them <strong>we</strong> can refuse cover, cancel <strong>your</strong> policy, or both.</p>
<ol>
<li>Where the <strong>breakdown</strong> is caused by a component failure this must stop the <strong>vehicle</strong> working. Faulty air-conditioning or the illumination of a warning light for example would not, on its own, be a <strong>breakdown</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>We</strong> will not cover any claim where the <strong>vehicle</strong> is already at a place of repair.</li>
<li><strong>We</strong> will not provide cover if <strong>we</strong> deem, acting reasonably, that <strong>you</strong> requested service to avoid the cost of repairs or to correct a repair by someone else.</li>
<li><strong>You</strong> (and a driver if <strong>you</strong> were not driving) must be with the <strong>vehicle</strong> at the time of the <strong>breakdown</strong> and when <strong>we</strong> attend.</li>

h. Vehicle storage charges. If <strong>your vehicle</strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> is being stored, </span><strong>you</strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> will be contacted at </span><strong>your</strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> last known address with details of how to arrange collection and any fees which may be payable. In extreme instances, where the </span><strong>vehicle</strong> has not been collected and fees not paid, the <strong>vehicle</strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> may be disposed of and any outstanding fees will be deducted. </span><strong>You</strong> will be notified, in accordance with legislation, prior to this happening.<br />

<li>If the emergency services, local authority or any government agency are handling the <strong>breakdown</strong>, <strong>we</strong> will only attend and provide recovery once instructed to do so by them. <strong>We</strong> will not cover their costs.</li>
<li>When <strong>we</strong> attend a <strong>breakdown</strong>, <strong>we</strong> may ask <strong>you</strong> to review a document or electronic form that records the condition of <strong>your vehicle</strong>. Please make sure this is accurate as <strong>we</strong> are not responsible for any errors or omissions.</li>

<h3>Advice or information</h3>
<p>We can only offer Car Breakdown Cover from RAC Motoring Services (the Insurer), and we act on behalf of the insurer.</p>
<p>The features and terms and conditions of the benefits within the Breakdown Cover Pack may not be the same as those for similar products available with Barclays.<br />
</p>
<p>The Breakdown Cover Pack is provided on a non-advised basis. As such, we will only provide information on the Breakdown Cover Pack and we will not make a personal recommendation about the suitability of this Breakdown Cover Pack.<br />
</p>
<h3>Compensation Scheme</h3>
<p>We are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). You may be entitled to compensation from the FSCS if we cannot meet our obligations in relation to arranging the insurance cover in the Pack, depending on the type of business and the circumstances of the claim. Insurance arranging is covered for 90% of the compensation claim, without any upper limit. You can obtain more information about the compensation scheme arrangements by contacting the FSCS on <strong>0207 741 1400</strong> or <strong>0800 678 1100*</strong> or by visiting their website at <a title="Opens in a new window" href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>fscs.org.uk</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>Change of insurer</h3>
<p>From time to time for commercial reasons we may decide to change the chosen insurer(s). If we do, we will write to you at least 30 days before we make any change, giving you details of the new insurer and any variations to the terms and conditions of cover.</p>
<p>Your cancellation rights are not affected.</p>
<h3>Statement of price</h3>
<p>The monthly cost of your Breakdown Cover Pack is £9.00 payable in advance on the first working day of each month. This means that the fee payable for the minimum term of Breakdown Cover Pack is £54.00. This fee will include Insurance Premium Tax at the current rate, and there are no further taxes or costs unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>The first monthly Breakdown Cover Pack fee is part payment for the rest of the month in which the Breakdown Cover Pack is purchased.<br />
</p>
<p>We hold the insurance premium you pay to us, and any premium refunds payable to you, in respect of the insurance products included in the Breakdown Cover Pack as agent of RAC Motoring Services, which means your insurance product is treated as being paid for when the Breakdown Cover Pack fee is collected by us.<br />
