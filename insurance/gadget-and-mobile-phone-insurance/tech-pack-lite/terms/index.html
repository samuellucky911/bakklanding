<h2 style="text-align: center;">Barclays Pack terms and conditions</h2>
<p>In these terms and conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘<strong>we</strong>’, ‘<strong>us</strong>’ and ‘<strong>our</strong>’ refers to Barclays Bank UK PLC and Barclays Insurance Services Company Limited, unless stated.</li>
<li>‘<strong>Pack holder</strong>’ is the person who made the application to purchase the Pack.</li>
<li>‘<strong>Partner</strong>’ is the person nominated by the Pack holder, who lives at the same address.</li>
<li>‘<strong>UK resident</strong>’ means a person who spends at least 183 days a year within England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<h3>If you have a Barclays current account</h3>
<p>You can apply for a Pack through Online Banking or the Barclays app.</p>
<p>These terms cover your Pack. If there’s inconsistency between these and the Retail Customer Agreement, these terms take priority in relation to the Packs.</p>
<p>A Pack is a set of services (such as insurance) available to any eligible person aged 18+ for a monthly fee. You can only purchase a Pack and claim the benefits included in it if you are a UK <span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0.0px;">resident.</span></p>
<p>Each of the benefits and services in the Packs is provided to you under a separate agreement with the provider of the relevant benefits or services and the provider is responsible for providing the relevant benefits and services to you. The provider may be a company within the Barclays group of <span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0.0px;">companies or by a company outside that group.</span></p>
<h3>Eligibility for Pack benefits</h3>
<p>Before choosing a Pack, you should check that you are eligible for the benefits under each policy or feature. We will provide information and ask you questions to help you do this. </p>
<h3>What you pay</h3>
<p>You pay a monthly fee in advance for each Pack purchased, as set out in the ‘Statement of Price’ within the About Our Insurance Services section. The Pack fee includes Insurance Premium Tax at the current rate. The monthly fee is the cost of the Pack as a whole. No part of any Pack fee is attributable to any particular benefit or service <span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0.0px;">in your Pack. You will not be entitled to a refund or reduction in the Pack fee if you choose not to use a benefit or service, you’re not eligible for a benefit or service, or it’s not otherwise available to you. You must have a Pack for a minimum term of six months from the date you purchase the Pack (unless we say otherwise in these terms) after which you can close the Pack at any time.</span></p>
<p>You may be able to add additional features to the services included in a Pack and we’ll tell you what these cost before you choose to add them.</p>
<p>By agreeing to these terms and conditions you provide Barclays authority to:</p>
<p>(i) debit a part payment of the monthly Pack fee to cover the period from the date on which you purchase the Pack, up to the last day of that month; and thereafter<br />
(ii) debit the monthly Pack fee<br />
(iii) apply a change in the monthly Pack fee subject to the appropriate notice period.</p>
<p>All payments will be taken in advance from your Barclays current account on the first working day of the month on an ongoing basis until your Pack is cancelled. You must ensure you have sufficient credit funds in your Barclays current <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">account to cover the monthly Pack fee, otherwise you may incur borrowing charges in line with any arrangement you have with us.</span></p>
<h3>Keeping each other informed</h3>
<p>We need you to tell us about changes to your situation or personal details, and we’ll keep you informed about certain things that affect you. Information will only be sent to you, the Pack holder.</p>
<p><strong>How we contact you</strong></p>
<p>We’ll contact you, the Pack holder, using the details you have given to us. This may include using your landline phone, mobile, email or home address. If you have a Barclays current account, we may also contact you through Online Banking or the Barclays app if you use these.</p>
<p>You can tell us how you want us to contact you, for example by post or your available digital channel. Where we can, we’ll contact you using your preferred method. We may not always be able to do this – for example, sometimes the law may require us to send you something by post. If we send information to you at the most recent postal address you have given us and it’s returned to us <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">as undelivered, we’ll stop using that address unless we are required by law or regulation to send you information.</span></p>
<p>If you have not told us how you’d prefer us to communicate, then we’ll normally contact you by email. If we send you information through Barclays Online Banking, we’ll text you or send you an email or other electronic message reminding you to view any new message we’ve posted. Where we do this, we won’t normally send documents to your home address as well (unless we have to or you have asked us to).</p>
<p>Once we’ve sent a message to you, we’ll assume you have received it. So it’s important to look out for notifications like emails or texts from us.</p>
<p>We are always working to make our services more convenient and flexible so we may introduce new ways of communicating with you in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Help us to keep your information private</strong></p>
<p>It’s your responsibility to control who reads your information. When you choose how you would like us to contact you, you should choose a method that will be most secure for you. If you use a method that other people can access or read (such as a shared email address or shared mobile number), please be aware that these people will <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">also be able to access the information we send you.</span></p>
<p><strong>Keeping your details up to date</strong></p>
<p>When we send information to you, we’ll send it to the most recent contact details we have for you. If these details change and you don’t tell us straight away, you may not receive information that could be important – or it could fall into the wrong hands. If you have given us contact details (even if you think we don’t use some of them, such as your mobile phone number), you must let us know if they change. This will include your:</p>
<ul>
<li>home address</li>
<li>email address</li>
<li>landline phone number</li>
<li>mobile phone number</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s very important that you also keep us informed if there are any changes to your situation, personal details or any other important changes that are relevant to us – for example, if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>change your name</li>
<li>move to another country and are no longer a UK resident</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t keep all your details up to date, this might affect your eligibility for a Pack(s), or how they work. This is also so we can continue to manage your Pack(s), and communicate with you including notifying you of changes. We also respect your privacy and we don’t want to send you <span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0.0px;">unwanted information.</span><br />
</p>
<p>If you wish to remove or change the Partner named on the Pack(s), we’ll close your Pack(s) to do this before opening a new Pack(s). The minimum term will re-start upon the purchase of a new Pack(s).</p>
<p><strong>Contacting us</strong></p>
<p>You can always contact us through your available digital channel, or other electronic methods we tell you about. You can also contact us by telephone using the details we give you, by visiting a branch or by post. We’ll let you know if our details change.</p>
<p>You can contact us by any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to the Barclays app and select the ‘call us’ feature</li>
<li>By telephone on <strong>0800 158 3199</strong></li>
<li>Visit your local branch</li>
<li>In writing to <strong>Barclays, Leicester LE87 2BB</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Closing your Pack or leaving Barclays</h3>
<p>Whilst we’d be very sorry to lose you, you can close your Pack within the 14-day cooling-off period, which starts the day your Pack is purchased or you receive your Welcome Pack, whichever is later. If you close your Pack within this period and have paid your first monthly Pack fee, it will be refunded. You can also close your Pack at any time after the minimum term explained below has ended. If we need to close your Pack, we’ll follow the process set out below.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum term</strong></p>
<p>You must have a Pack for a minimum term of six months from the date you open the Pack, after which you can close the Pack at any time.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this minimum term requirement. You may close your Pack:</p>
<ul>
<li>within the 14-day cooling-off period as set out above</li>
<li>if you experience financial hardship due to a significant change in personal circumstances, for example, you’re declared bankrupt</li>
<li>if you’re no longer resident in the UK</li>
<li>after we have notified you of an unfavourable change to the terms of the Pack you hold, such as an increase in price or a change in what the Pack provides (provided that you do so before the change takes effect)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you tell us you want to close your Pack, closure will take effect on the day that we receive notice from you (so the insurance and your right to receive any of the other services within the Pack will end on the date we receive your notice). You will receive a part refund for the remaining number of days in that month, including the day we receive your notice. You won’t be able to use any benefits or services linked to it any more although you can still make a claim for an event which occurred whilst you were insured.</p>
<p>We will not let you re-select the same Pack for 12 months if you cancel it within the minimum term, or your Barclays current account is closed by Barclays Financial Assistance or if you do not comply with these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>You are unable to cancel individual insurance Pack products, only the whole Pack.</p>
<p>You can cancel your Pack within the Barclays app, Online Banking, by calling us, visiting a branch or writing to <strong>Barclays, Leicester LE87 2BB</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>When we can close a Pack</strong></p>
<p>We can close a Pack by giving you at least 30 calendar days’ notice. This also applies during the minimum term. However, we may close your Pack immediately or on less notice if we reasonably believe you have seriously or persistently broken any terms of the agreement or we reasonably believe any of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>you put us in a position where we might break a law, regulation, code or other duty that applies to us if we maintain your Pack</li>
<li>you give us any false or inaccurate information at any time</li>
<li>you commit (or attempt) fraud against us or someone else</li>
<li>you behave in a threatening or abusive manner to our staff</li>
<li>you become bankrupt</li>
<li>your Barclays current account is closed by Barclays Financial Assistance</li>
</ul>
<p>The insurer may also cancel the insurance policies within Tech Pack Lite as set out in the terms and conditions of the policy document.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Current Account Switch Service</strong></p>
<p>If you decide to switch your current account from us by using the Current Account Switch Service, your Pack will be closed on the same day that your Current Account is closed.</p>
<h3>Changes we can make to this agreement</h3>
<p>Sometimes we’ll want or need to change things, such as charges or terms of our agreement. For most changes, we’ll tell you in advance, but we don’t always need to do this.</p>
<p>We review the Packs from time to time and may make changes to them, including the benefits and services included in a Pack or the providers of these or the monthly Pack fee. We may also <span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0.0px;">make changes to the terms on which each benefit is provided (such as changes to the terms of an individual policy). We’ll give you 30 calendar days’ notice before any changes apply.</span></p>
<p>If we make changes to a Pack, we will provide information about you to any new provider to make sure there is no interruption in the benefit or service you receive. The new provider will use your information to provide you with the benefits and services.</p>
<p><strong>Changes we need to tell you about in advance</strong></p>
<p>We may make changes to your agreement with us because:</p>
<ul>
<li>we’re changing a service we already offer, or introducing a new service that needs a change to the terms of this agreement, such as introducing a new charge</li>
<li>we’re changing the agreement to be in line with the banking industry and our competitors<br />
</li>
<li>we’re withdrawing a service or type of Pack</li>
<li>we’re moving you from one type of Pack to another for a good reason – examples of this include where we’re withdrawing a Pack</li>
<li>we need to make changes to take account of developments (or changes we reasonably expect to help) in technology (including the systems we use to run our business), or in the banking system generally</li>
<li>our agreement or the Pack is affected by a change in the law or regulation (including industry <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">codes we follow) or decisions of the Financial Ombudsman, a regulator or court</span></li>
<li>changes in our costs (including changes we reasonably expect to happen) mean we need to change or introduce charges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because you may have your Pack with us for many years, we need the flexibility to manage our business long term, including providing a sufficient financial return for us to operate our business in a prudent and sustainable manner. We can’t predict everything that may affect our business, so there may be other reasons we have not set out above when we need to make a change. But please be <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">assured we’ll only make changes we think are fair and will give you 30 calendar days’ notice of the change unless we are prevented from doing so by law or regulation, or the change is in your favour.</span></p>
<p>If we give you notice as set out above and you don’t tell us you want to close your Pack, then we’ll treat you as having accepted the change. If you don’t want to accept the change and want to end this agreement and close the Pack, you must tell us before the proposed change applies.</p>
<p><strong>Changes we don’t need to tell you about in advance</strong></p>
<p>We don’t have to tell you about changes to these terms and conditions (or changes in the insurer terms and conditions) in advance when any of the following happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the change is in your favour</li>
<li>we make a change because a change in law or regulation says that we have to by a particular date, and there isn’t time to give you notice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions for your Pack(s)</strong></p>
<p>We will only accept instructions from the Pack holder about the Pack (including to change your contact preferences and to apply for new Packs, products and services).</p>
<p>Your partner will be able to register a product, if required, or make a claim for the Pack benefits or services. They cannot provide any other instructions in relation to the Pack.</p>
<p><strong>If you think your security has been compromised</strong></p>
<p>If you think someone (except someone you have asked to provide Pack information) has used or is able to use any of the means of access to your <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Pack, you must tell us as soon as you can by using the contact details shown in the ‘Unauthorised access to your Pack?’ section.</span></p>
<p>If you have a Barclays current account, we can arrange to temporarily suspend access to a service (such as Telephone Banking) to prevent anyone misusing your Pack(s).</p>
<p>You must give us any information we ask for about what has happened. We’ll pass this to the police if we have to, or if we think that will be useful.</p>

Therefore, You will need to provide some form of proof of ownership, such as a Device purchase receipt, or statement from Your network service provider to Likewize.

This could include documentation to show when the Device was last used or to verify Your identity. Likewize will confirm what information, if anything, is required during the claims process.</p>
<p>If You have any problems in getting any supporting documentation Likewize requires, please contact them so they can guide You on how to obtain these. It is important that You provide Likewize with the relevant information they have requested as soon as possible.

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: For Damage or Breakdown claims, if Your Device has any software-locking mechanism (e.g. Find My iPhone/iPad or similar feature), You must disable or remove the software and confirm that You have done so to Likewize before Likewize can proceed with Your claim.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Pay the Excess.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You must pay the applicable Excess to Likewize for every approved claim, which includes repair, a replacement or a Cash Settlement or an e-voucher.</li>
<li>Your Excess can be paid by Visa, MasterCard and debit cards. Likewize does not accept American Express or Diners Club cards. Likewize will inform You of other payment options that may be available during Your claims process.</li>
<li>If there are multiple registered Devices involved in the same incident, each registered Device will be treated as a separate claim and an Excess will be payable for each Device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Excesses that will apply in relation to each type of claim under the Policy will be higher during the first year that you hold the Policy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Excesses that apply until You have held this Tech Pack Lite for one year are as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Mobile Phones:</strong></p>
<p>– If Your Mobile Phone is Damaged and You choose to repair Your Device (if the repair option is offered to You), Your non-refundable Excess is £79.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT: For all claims,</strong> if You select the repair option and Likewize is unable to repair Your Device, they will contact You to discuss alternative options. If Likewize contacts You to provide a replacement Device, You will be required to pay the difference between the repair Excess and the replacement Excess.<br />
 </p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Likewize, or its authorised repair provider, will either repair Your Device or send You a replacement wherever possible. If the make and model of Your claimed Device is not available, we will contact you to discuss the alternative options. </p>
<p><strong>Repair</strong>. If Likewize, or its authorised repair provider, attempts to repair Your Device and the locking mechanism is enabled, it will delay Your claim and they may return Your Device to You unrepaired for You to remove any locking mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement</strong>. For Damage and Breakdown claims, if Likewize discovers that, after providing You with a replacement Device, the software-locking mechanism, such as Find My iPhone or equivalent feature, has been enabled on Your Device, Likewize may charge You an amount up to the current new recommended retail price of the replacement Device provided to You.</p>
<p><strong>For Damage and Breakdown Claims:<br />
 </strong>When sending in Your Device, DO NOT send in Your SIM or memory card, any other accessories or any other items that do not relate to the claim such as the manual or box as these will be destroyed. These items will not be returned to You. When Your Device is received, all remaining data and content will be erased as part of the claims process. Please ensure You take the necessary steps to back up Your data prior to sending Your Device to Likewize as they are not responsible for any data or content on Your Device that may be lost during the claims process.</p>
<p>Damaged or broken-down Devices and parts and materials replaced by Likewize shall become Our property. If Likewize has provided You with a replacement Device as part of the claims process and You do not return the exact Device that You filed a claim for, Likewize will take steps to recover the replacement Device provided to You, or it will collect an equivalent cash value up to the manufacturer’s current new recommended retail price. Likewize will also take action to bar the replacement Device provided to You in order to prevent it from being used.</p>
<p>Please note, that once a device has been returned to Likewize, they will be unable to return this to You.</p>
<p><strong>Device Warranty</strong></p>
<p>This Policy is provided in addition to any applicable manufacturer’s warranty that applies to Your Device. Nothing in this Policy is intended to affect Your rights under the warranty or Your statutory rights.</p>
<p>If any repairs authorised by Likewize under this Policy invalidate this warranty, Likewize will repair or replace Your Device, as necessary, in accordance with the terms of the warranty for the unexpired period.</p>
<p>All repairs and/or replacements provided by Likewize, or its authorised repair providers, come with a twenty-four (24) month warranty provided by Likewize.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that the replacement phone You receive has damage when you receive it, You must notify Likewize within 72 hours of accepting the delivery. If You notify Likewize later than this, they may deem the damage to have occurred after the phone was received by You. Cosmetic damage to the replacement phone Likewize have provided You with is not covered under the warranty</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">About our insurance services</h2>
<p><strong>In the following section ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to Barclays Bank UK PLC and Barclays Insurance Services Company Limited.</strong></p>
<p>Barclays Bank UK PLC arranges insurance through Barclays Insurance Services Company Limited, which is a wholly owned subsidiary company of Barclays Bank UK PLC. Both companies are insurance intermediaries.</p>
<h3>Name and address of the insurance intermediaries</h3>
<p>The registered address of Barclays Bank UK PLC and Barclays Insurance Services Company Limited is <strong>1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP</strong>.</p>
<h3>Financial Services Register</h3>
<p>Barclays Bank UK PLC is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority (Financial Services Register No. 759676).</p>
<p>Barclays Insurance Services Company Limited is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (Financial Services Register No. 312078).</p>

<h3>Advice or information</h3>
<p>We can only offer Mobile Phone Insurance and Gadget Cover from Aviva Insurance Limited (the insurer), and we act on behalf of the insurer.</p>
<p>The features and terms and conditions of the benefits within the Tech Pack Lite may not be the same as those for similar products available with Barclays.</p>
<p>The Tech Pack Lite is provided on a non-advised basis. As such, we will only provide information on the Tech Pack Lite and we will not make a personal recommendation about the suitability of this Tech Pack Lite.</p>
<h3>Compensation Scheme</h3>
<p>We are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). You may be entitled to compensation from the FSCS if we cannot meet our obligations in relation to arranging the insurance cover in the Pack, depending on the type of business and the circumstances of the claim. Insurance arranging is covered for 90% of the compensation claim, without any upper limit. You can obtain more information about the compensation scheme arrangements by contacting the FSCS on <strong>0207 741 1400</strong> or <strong>0800 678 1100*</strong> or by visiting their website at <a title="Opens in a new window" href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>fscs.org.uk</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>Change of insurer</h3>
<p>From time to time for commercial reasons we may decide to change the chosen insurance provider(s) that provide the insurance policy included in your Pack. If we do, we will write to you at least 30 days before we make any change, giving you details of the new insurance provider(s) (including the insurer of the policy) and any variations to the terms and conditions of cover. Your existing policy underwritten by Aviva Insurance Limited and administered by Likewize Device Protection <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">UK Limited will end once your policy with the new insurer comes into effect.</span></p>
<p>Your cancellation rights are not affected.</p>
<h3>Statement of price</h3>
<p>The monthly cost of your Tech Pack Lite is £9.00 per month, payable in advance on the first working day of each month. This means that the fee payable for the minimum term of Tech Pack Lite is £54.00. This fee will include Insurance Premium Tax at the current rate, and there are no further taxes or costs unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>The first monthly Tech Pack Lite fee is part payment for the rest of the month in which the Tech Pack Lite is purchased.</p>
<p>If you cancel the Tech Pack Lite or fail to pay the monthly Teck Pack Lite fee, you will not receive any of the benefits from the date on which the unpaid amount was due.</p>
<p>We hold the insurance premium you pay to us, and any premium refunds payable to you, in respect of the insurance products included in the Tech Pack Lite as agent of  Aviva Insurance Limited, which means your insurance product is treated as being paid for when the Tech Pack Lite fee is collected by us.</p>
