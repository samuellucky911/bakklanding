00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.720
Hello and welcome to the June episode of Monthly 
Market Insights. I'm Phil Attreed, Barclays Head  

2
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.320
of Wealth Specialists. And as usual, I'm joined 
by Will Hobbs our Chief Investment Officer.  

3
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.640
Now, Will, it's been another turbulent month 
across investment markets and whilst I'm sure  

4
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.240
it's very stimulating for the investment teams 
in their day-to-day work, investors I think are  

5
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.240
probably looking forward to the episode where 
I'm going to be able to stop saying that.

6
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.840
100 per cent, Phil. I can't say it's going to 
come anytime soon, I'm afraid, but yes, I agree.

7
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.920
I get that feeling as well. But anyway, 
Will and I are going to have a go as usual  

8
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.040
unpicking what's going on in the world. Also 
what the path ahead might look like and so hot  

9
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.720
topics really continue to be about oil, inflation, 
central banks, and I suppose a little bit more  

10
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.800
about the hunt for stock and 
bond opportunities that might be  

11
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.945
out there particularly at current levels. So, 
Will, could you set the scene for us if you can?

12
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.920
Phil, that's not easy question actually more and 
more difficult than usual. I'll try and do like a  

13
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.080
brief world tour because each region is facing its 
own set of quite individual challenges some of the  

14
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.520
same ones as well, but with quite individual 
toolkits as well. So if you start with the US  

15
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.080
because that's still by miles the most important 
for us as we know in terms of the outlook for  

16
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:44.240
investment markets. If you start there, the good 
news is that the data is okay. The economy is slowing,  

17
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.720
but you want that to be the case. That sounds 
perverse but as we've explained before this is  

18
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.320
what central bankers are trying to achieve. This 
is what mostly people want to achieve in order to  

19
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.400
try and reconnect aggregate demand with aggregate 
supply so that you get this inflationary pressures  

20
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.000
under control again, but, they need to cool demand 
for everything basically, for workers, for goods,  

21
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.880
for services. But incoming economic data, the 
latest batch of data suggest that the US economy  

22
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.680
has quite a bit of cooling to do before the 
central bankers will feel relieved enough to stop  

23
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:35.040
trying to get interest rates up at such a sharp 
level. Europe has a job to do too on this front,  

24
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.160
in terms of that inflationary story. That's the 
same thing really at work for somewhat subtler  

25
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.720
different reasons but they've got obviously the 
added complication of the unfolding tragedy in  

26
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.760
Ukraine and proximity there and everything that's 
going on there obviously creates a much more  

27
00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.240
uncertain outlook for the European economy. If you 
think about if the gas supply which still could  

28
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.600
be cut off that plunges Europe into an immediate 
economic darkness and that's not quite foreseeable  

29
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.680
very easily calculable in terms of the odds that 
that might happen. So you want to be wary of  

30
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.080
overconfidence there. In China, they're continuing 
to, the policymakers continue to play ‘Waco mole’  

31
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.080
against Omicron which as we know is a much more 
transmissible variant, it's proving difficult as  

32
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.160
the news from Shanghai this week suggests and 
there you've seen a very sharp deterioration  

33
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.680
in economic activity because of that battle and 
that's made things very difficult in the short  

34
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.480
run there. Further out, you should see a bounce 
back, activity inevitably will bounce back but  

35
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.280
we've said before that the outlook for China is 
difficult as well. It's like I say, it's really  

36
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.080
very different outlooks and different regions and 
the big story on the consumer side is this excess  

37
00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.280
savings pile that we've talked about before: how 
will that be deployed to what extent will it be  

38
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.320
deployed and region to region? In the US it's 
perceived to be a bit more evenly distributed  

39
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.720
across households and therefore maybe a bit more 
likely to be deployed and the latest spending data  

40
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.320
showed that that was a little bit the case. 
They're dipping into their excess savings.  

41
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.000
That's a little bit more questionable in Europe, 
UK as well. The perception here is that it's a  

42
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.840
bit more unevenly distributed, more clustered in 
the top 40% by income distribution and that has  

43
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.000
a different outcome in terms of what you would 
expect to be spent, if that all makes sense.

44
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.637
It does indeed. You made reference a 
couple of times there but the big question  

45
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.280
at the moment appears to be when we're likely to 
see the friendlier side of central bankers again.

46
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.640
Yes, it'd be nice wouldn’t it? It feels a long 
way away right now. It's amazing to think,  

47
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.680
if you look at this year from a little over 
a year ago and you look at what markets and  

48
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.680
most were expecting at that stage and 
forecasting for 2022, it was really about  

49
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.840
central bankers sitting on their hands for 
much of it, still in nurture mode, trying to  

50
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.640
nurture the economy back from the blows of the 
pandemic. And yet you fast forward to today and  

51
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.840
you have got quite the opposite; you are already 
in the US deep into rate-rising cycles, you've got  

52
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.560
coming in the US, the next few meetings are 
expected to be again chunky rate rises. They’re  

53
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.080
going to be a good deal higher by the end of the 
summer. The question mark for investors, like you  

54
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.720
say, there is: when do those central bankers not 
just stop raising interest rates, but when do they  

55
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.600
change their communication a little bit? That will 
be the thing for investors to watch. There’s not  

56
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.880
much sign of it at the moment and you want to be a 
little bit wary, the energy prices are now pushing  

57
00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.080
out some of those expectations with regards to 
the plausible peaking inflation even in the US.  

58
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.320
So it's a very complicated backdrop there. 
I suspect a tough summer ahead. That's the  

59
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.520
current expectation. That could change, like I 
say, but that's our current base expectation.

60
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.440
And I suppose with that in mind, it'd 
be pretty tempting to certainly wait  

61
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:29.520
until making any substantial increases to stock 
markets to equity exposure. Would that be fair?

62
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.560
Yes, so it's interesting isn't it? Because a lot 
of people will look at pullbacks of the size  

63
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.120
we've seen and look at it and say that's naturally 
tantalising. If you look on a probability basis  

64
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.920
you look at the size of the pullback relative 
to historic pullbacks you would say that  

65
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:54.880
buyers would get interested. We would say 
it's not as easy as that really, the outlook as 

66
00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.880
I've described is sufficiently complicated to be 
relatively low conviction. That's reflected in our  

67
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.560
Tactical Asset Allocation book; there's a batch 
of short-term positions the team focuses on to try  

68
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.720
and add those little performance cherries here 
and there to the overall SAA performance cake,  

69
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:25.200
the Strategic Asset Allocation cake. But what you 
can see there is that the book is what's called  

70
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:31.280
relatively flat. We're not, there's not massive 
positions at the moment. The team is scouring  

71
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.920
the world for opportunity. But at the moment 
it's discretion is the better part of valour.  

72
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.080
Like I say the outlook for central banking and 
inflation, it's so uncertain at the moment and  

73
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:49.280
it is very, it's dictating, it’s a really 
strong market influence at the moment that  

74
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.000
inflation story and the uncertainty that 
surrounds the short-term outlook there  

75
00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.360
should mean that for the moment anyway, we're 
more cautiously positioned in that tactical book.

76
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.600
Yes, not a time to be too bold just yet. But I 
guess one positive to take out of the start of  

77
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.720
the year and some of the moves that we've seen 
both in stocks and bonds is that the return  

78
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.080
prospect I suppose maybe for the years ahead 
maybe look a little bit more attractive than  

79
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.760
they have done in the past. I think you'd made 
reference that a little bit in what you just said.

80
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.840
Yes, this is a little bit, in these very difficult 
times, I guess this is a weird thing,

81
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:36.640
but this is an investment video, isn't it? But 
yes, you're right. I think your expected returns  

82
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:43.200
probably are a little bit higher than they were. 
The backup in bond yields is helpful there. Stocks  

83
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.640
have fallen some distance in some corners as 
well. So there's less froth and we talked in  

84
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.840
our outlook actually about the need for some of 
that froth to get blown off markets at some stage.  

85
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.840
As always when it comes it's more shocking than 
writing about it in advance or speaking about it  

86
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.640
in advance. But yes, the expected returns are 
higher and that really is always the finishing  

87
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:11.680
point for our conversations. You must be so 
bored of hearing it by now but hopefully it gets  

88
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:19.120
through. Repetition, I hope, and conviction, it's 
my personal belief as well, is that there's no  

89
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.640
point in getting too caught up on what's going on 
right now in a very confusing tactical backdrop.  

90
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:31.600
The returns to longer term investments that's just 
about making sure you're fully invested all the  

91
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.800
time. Don't worry too much about what's going 
on in the short term. These are fluctuations.  

92
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.640
Your entry point right now as in days and 
months won't make a big difference in terms  

93
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:49.280
of your long-term returns expectation. Those 
short-term tactical tweaks, that's more about  

94
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.680
adding basis points here and there. Like I say 
the meat and drink of your returns is just going  

95
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.960
to be from being invested and having faith that 
over the long term, humankind will continue to  

96
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.760
invent new stuff and get better at using that new 
stuff, productivity. And that was what will drive  

97
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.480
your returns and as you know, I have strong 
faith that will be the case, we can go through  

98
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:16.560
that on another podcast again, but I think 
that's the major point to take away as usual.

99
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.480
There’s always certainly interesting things 
going on in the world. Will, thank you as always,  

100
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.880
very insightful and thank you our viewers and 
listeners for joining us. If you would like to

the next month between episodes, please do seek
