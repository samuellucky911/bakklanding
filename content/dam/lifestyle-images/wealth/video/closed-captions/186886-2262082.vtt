00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:12.720
So, being a wealth manager in the day to day is first getting to know your clients,

2
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.680
planning for the future, 
their investments,

3
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.800
and accompanying them in the implementation of that plan.

4
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.160
My team is mostly dedicated 
to professionals,

5
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.040
so we find the big accountancy 
and law firms

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.200
and mainly their partners

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.640
as we try to accompany them all along the way of their career.

8
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.800
I've always loved the people aspect 
of that job

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.960
and the fact that I speak to people on a day to day.

10
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.000
I help them and I like when the clients are engaged

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and trying to challenge me, really.

12
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.560
Quite often people come to you with a set goal in mind

13
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.160
and then you start talking to them and that set goal evolves.

14
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.040
Even sometimes just disappears completely to the benefit of the new plan.

15
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.080
Of the new goal.

16
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.680
You know a lot of clients come 
to me and say, 

17
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.280
Oh, I'm interested, I want to plan ahead,

18
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.800
but I'm not sure that I'm a wealth client in terms of the amount I have to invest.

19
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.360
And so what we tell them is it's something that's built along the years.

20
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.760
So, we need to be there as early as possible to put in place a structure for that wealth

21
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.840
so that when we start investing it,

22
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.640
it's already in a place where it's allowed to grow in the best way possible.

23
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.560
I've been in the industry my whole career and I've worked with other big banks before,

24
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.920
and what I like about Barclays Wealth

25
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.040
is that we do have this holistic view on the client's situation

26
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.720
going from the day-to-day admin and account maintenance

27
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.080
all the way through investment structuring, credit facilities.

28
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.440
We're going to assist with literally everything that you might need to help with.
