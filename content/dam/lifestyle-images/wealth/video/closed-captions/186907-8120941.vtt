00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.440
Essentially, as a Wealth Manager,

2
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.400
my role is to support my clients

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.240
in creating an investment plan

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.680
that suits their needs.

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.440
Every day is different, which is one

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.880
of the reasons why I love the job

7
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.320
because no two clients are the same.

8
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.920
So my specialism that I work with within

9
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.200
the team is sport, media and entertainment clients. 

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
So my client book tends to be

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.600
a lot younger than probably the average wealth client.

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.680
So I get a lot of clients coming to me asking

13
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.040
a lot around the retirement piece,

14
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.440
especially where someone's retirement might be at

15
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.840
35 years old rather than the traditional 55 at the moment.

16
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.840
That's quite a big topic of conversation.

17
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.200
How can you make that money last,

18
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.240
what could be 80 plus years for some clients?

19
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.920
So I suppose the reason that I love

20
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.880
my job and I do what I do is because

21
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.120
I love talking to people.

22
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.120
And the kind of crux of the role

23
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.920
of being a Wealth Manager, it's

24
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.040
relationship management.

25
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.040
You want to really understand people

26
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.480
and what positions they’re in,

27
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.000
in order to really give them the best advice possible.
