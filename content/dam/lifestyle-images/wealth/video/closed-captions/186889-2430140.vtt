1
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.800
So, as a wealth manager at Barclays, I operate 
in a special focused professionals team,

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.000
really looking to work alongside people in law, accountancy,

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.640
insurance, to help them take away the everyday stress a financial burden can bring.

4
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.000
So, we work with clients on their short-term plan, such as helping them buy a house,

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.720
a medium-term plan, helping out with kids' school fees,

6
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.840
building up an investment pot, and their longer-term plan,

7
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.920
which is focusing around retirement and legacy planning.

8
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.560
So, one of my favourite parts of my job is puzzle solving.

9
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.400
I tried to formulate a plan where we can execute as to exactly what they want

10
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.320
and help them achieve their goals.

11
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.920
I think one of the big things that really drew me into wealth management

12
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.880
was the ability to work with individuals on a one-on-one basis.

13
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.840
When we pass across a plan to clients and watch them 

14
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.880
go through the process of them understanding and it clicking in their mind,

15
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.520
you very quickly see people 
leave their seats

16
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.080
because they're already daydreaming about  

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.120
what those goals are going to help them achieve in the future,

18
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.000
whether it's for them as individuals or for their broader family.

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.040
What we're really trying to do at Barclays Wealth in the Professional Services team

20
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.120
is make your life easier, give you time back in your diary.

21
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.720
So when you do have a spare moment after a long day of working,

22
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.000
you can go and spend it 
with your family.

23
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.360
You don't have to sit down and start worrying about your finances

24
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.720
because you know that investment professionals such as myself

25
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.640
are looking at it, day in, day out.

26
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.160
Working for a big bank like Barclays gives us the benefit of going away

27
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.640
and drawing on a lot of 
different specialists

28
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.560
to make sure that our clients can lay the right tracks to have a smooth

29
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.960
and comfortable journey in helping them achieve their life goals.
