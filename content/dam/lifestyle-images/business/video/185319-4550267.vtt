00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.640
I'm Sarah Melhuish. I'm Marketing Manager here at the world of Beatrix Potter Attraction and the Old Laundry Theatre.

2
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.200
The World of Beatrix Potter is a beautiful, enchanting walk through exhibition of Beatrix Potter's 23 tales.

3
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.120
So you really feel like you're walking through 
the pages of her books

4
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.080
with sights, sounds, and even some smells of the farmyard 
or Mrs Tiggywinkles washing.

5
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.680
Sustainability is a really key part of our ethos here at the attraction
  and the Old Laundry Theatre.

6
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.000
It's the strand that goes through 
everything we do here,

7
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.960
and it's also carrying on the legacy of Beatrix Potter, who wanted 
 to protect the Lake District and the environment.

8
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.320
We wanted to find a much more sustainable solution 
to our theatre lighting

9
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.240
so this year we've changed all our theatre lighting to LED lights, which are much more energy efficient.

10
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.200
My name is Andrew and I am the in-house technician for the 
 Old Laundry Theatre.

11
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.320
We swapped over to LED lighting because we 
were on Tungsten Halogen,

12
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.120
which is quite an old technology and it's quite 
wasteful in terms of energy.

13
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.760
With our old setup, we were burning the equivalent 
of 25 electric kettles.

14
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.640
With this one, we are actually down to three. So we have 
reduced our energy footprint by 88%.

15
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.120
I'm Tim Wright. 
 I work in the garden.

16
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.920
So I've been here now for 13 years, 
 and in all that time,

17
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.760
we've been as sustainable and environmentally 
friendly as we can.

18
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.320
Six years ago, we bought 
an electric van.

19
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.400
We charge it from photovoltaic cells 
that we have on the roof.

20
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.400
We have organic seed that we grow. 
We cut it, we take it down,

21
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.200
it can be used within the hour from being cut here to being on somebody's plate at the attraction.

22
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.480
Small steps, but something 
that we can all do.

23
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.960
Our relationship manager at Barclays 
really does get our business

24
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.040
and so it's been a great part of our 
 sustainability journey.

25
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.120
We're really happy with our 
 sustainable solutions here.

26
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.600
I think it's everyone's social responsibility to do as much as we can 
 to try and protect our planet as we go forward,

27
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.160
so we would really encourage other businesses to try and 
do as much as they can too.
