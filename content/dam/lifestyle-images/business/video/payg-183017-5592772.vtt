If you’re a Bounce Back Loan Scheme borrower and you’re coming to the end of your first year,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
you may have concerns about your upcoming repayments. 

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
To help businesses manage repayments, the Government has announced a variety of Pay As You Grow options

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
that could give you more time and flexibility to pay back your loan. 

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
There are three Pay As You Grow options to consider.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
One: request an extension of your loan term from six years to ten,

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
at the same fixed interest rate of 2.5%.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Two: take one six-month repayment holiday.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
And three: reduce your monthly repayments for six months

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
by paying interest only.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
You can do this up to three times throughout the term of your loan.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
You can use these options individually or in combination with each other.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
But please note for all three options that the total amount you owe will go up.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
So, how do you access Pay As You Grow?

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Your lender will get in touch to outline your Pay As You Grow options

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
three months before your repayments are due to start.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
 At which point, you can make a decision around which of these options

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
suit your business - if you need them.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
If you want to learn more about managing debt and your cashflow,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
