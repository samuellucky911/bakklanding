00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.240
My name is Mark Lee and I 
farm here with my wife Jenny.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.680
We are at Park House Organic Farm.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.760
We milk 130 Friesian Jersey cross cows 

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.440
who are outside on grass for 300 days a year.

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.560
And we use the milk
to produce our own cheese and butter.

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.840
Having sprayed a field

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.160
back in 2016 to get rid of some weeds
and one of the nozzles

8
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.960
in our sprayer blocking, the field was striped

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.400
and we realized the cows are grazing
the bits that hadn't been sprayed.

10
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.920
So that was our light bulb moment
where we thought,

11
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.440
Well, what are we actually doing
by spraying the fields?

12
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.800
And then we took the next step,
which was becoming organic

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.920
and thinking more about the soils
and the grasses

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.800
that we grow so that we had full control
over what the cows were eating.

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.800
We became 100% PFLA certified,

16
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.160
so we just feed the cows pasture
because we don't use chemical fertilizer,

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
we don't spray, we don't use any pesticides.

18
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.280
We're trying to farm with nature
rather than battling against it constantly

19
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.880
because it is only
ever going to be one winner.

20
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.720
We work closely with our 
relationship manager at Barclays.

21
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.800
We really value
having that personal, traditional touch.

22
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.800
This is a third generation farm,
and my dad and my granddad

23
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.960
both banked with Barclays and
they have seen many changes on the farm

24
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.080
and they're always there to discuss
any changes, any new ideas we have.

25
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.640
When you make fundamental changes
to the way that you farm, it comes at a cost.

26
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.560
So we needed to partner up with a bank
that we could trust

27
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.360
and a bank that we knew would deliver for us.

28
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.920
We produce cheese and butter

29
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.840
for over 20 different outlets
locally within Cumbria.

30
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.640
We're producing and selling
milk directly to six coffee shops,

31
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.760
and we're reducing the amount of plastic
in that supply chain.

32
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.240
It's really important in terms of a connection for 
people to understand where their foodâ€™s from

33
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.840
and it gives us a great opportunity to 
explain how we farm and why we farm

34
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.040
and how that product is directly 
related to where they live.
