00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.120
I'm Martin Howitt, I'm the managing director of 
Grantham Manufacturing Ltd.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.240
This is a business which was started
in the late Sixties by my father,

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.480
so I moved into it in the late Seventies
as the second generation.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.800
Moved it from being a gasket
making business to the business

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.920
that it sort of evolved into today,
which is specialist paper converting.

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.000
About 2014...

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.280
we had a factory fire,

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.960
and that destroyed all of our factory
and all of our manufacturing capability.

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.880
So when the fire took place, you know,
you're faced with a heck of a challenge,

10
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.800
you either fall over and run away from it
or you get stuck into it,

11
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.160
and you take on a vast challenge
of rebuilding your business swiftly.

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.080
We came up with a dream of how we wanted
the factory to look going forward

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.560
in order that we can future-proof ourselves,

14
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.280
but that was going to take
a big investment at that time

15
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.920
and a business looks rather critical
when everything's burnt down.

16
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.280
You need to have somebody that's going to
have a lot of faith in your business plan,

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.080
and I'm pleased to say that the 
relationship manager we've got with Barclays

18
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.120
bought into my dream as to how 
we were going to rebuild this business.

19
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.560
In designing and building a new factory

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.960
we wanted to make sure we built features
into that to reduce its

21
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.760
carbon impact, so we applied for  

22
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.080
and we got permission to put 272 solar panels

23
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.880
on the brand new roof that we were building.

24
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.600
We're now in a situation
where we are generating

25
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.120
over a period of 12 months,
58% of our own electricity.

26
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.800
We also harvest our rainwater.

27
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.160
We've got a 10,000 litre
tank in the ground.

28
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.200
So all the rainwater
is gathered, filtered, and we can use that

29
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.680
in our processes.

30
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.160
In addition, we've got a ground source heating system.

31
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.800
We've got boreholes in the ground,

32
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.240
so the system is pre-heated
by the temperature of the earth,

33
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.400
which is generally ten degrees,
and that is what's responsible

34
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.840
for maintaining the temperature
in the factory.

35
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.880
More recently, we've invested
in a specially designed for us,

36
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.080
water cooled air compressor.

37
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.680
I'm excited to be a part

38
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.400
of seeing the third generation
come into this business.

39
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.280
My two sons have joined
and brought their own skills base to it

40
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.880
in order they can take 
the business plan forward

41
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.760
and into the future.

42
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.440
So the business now carries on
trying to work at the sustainability model

43
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.080
that we've got, be it
from sources of raw materials

44
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.480
or all the features
we built into this factory

45
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.880
and I'm very passionate

46
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.760
that that's one of the legacies
that I want to leave

47
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.120
behind in this business
for the next generation to build on.
