00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm Dale Young

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.200
and I'm a Net Zero specialist for Barclays
Business Bank.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.760
A Net Zero specialist is a representative, 
that's able to support customers

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.160
who are on their journey
of becoming net zero by 2050.

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.080
Now, the great thing about these
appointments, is they are done virtually,

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.400
so you can do it in the comfort 
of your own home or office,

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.960
but also, you can bring multiple 
people into the call.

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.560
We asked business customers to meet
one of three of the eligibility criterias.

9
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.800
We want to help customers break that net
zero strategy down into three scopes.

10
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.040
We want the customers to think

11
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.840
about what they can control,
such as the energy tariff.

12
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.640
And also, we want them to think
about things that are outside of their control.

13
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.400
Things like how they're 
getting goods into the UK,

14
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.440
have they actually got a baseline in place

15
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.760
that will help them formulate
a plan to get to net zero by 2050.

16
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.560
And then we work with customers to see how
they can really meet and exceed that goal.

17
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.640
Another really important factor
which we help customers on

18
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.840
is about winning
and retaining business.

19
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.080
You will find that having a net zero plan
may put you on the front foot

20
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.400
over your competitors.

21
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.600
What we're finding
is, with mainly with blue chip companies,

22
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.480
is that they are now
contacting their supply chain,

23
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.880
asking them whether they actually
have a net zero plan in place.

24
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.480
One great memory I have is of a 
business I helped called The British Emporium.

25
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.800
They initially started off
with a net zero plan,

26
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.760
but now that net zero plan has expanded
and they have now published that plan

27
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.200
into a policy which is now visible
on The British Emporium website.

28
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.480
Beyond the Policy, British Emporium, 
are really putting their plan into action.

29
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.200
They're using LED lighting and 
plastic-free shelving in-store.

30
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
They're using recyclable cups
and second-hand furniture,

31
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.400
and they're also sourcing
all of their products from Great Britain

32
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.880
to avoid long-distance travel 
by air or by sea.

33
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.000
The sustainability journey is forever
evolving, and it's really important

34
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.320
that we stay close to our customers
and support them wherever we can.

35
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.200
It doesnâ€™t matter what size turnover you are,
what industry you are in.

36
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.840
We just really are keen to support you
on the journey

37
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.040
of reaching your net zero objectives.
