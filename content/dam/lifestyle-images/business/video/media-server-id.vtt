00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.200
My name is Richard Odendaal,

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.680
and I'm the Managing Director of AGS
Support Facilities Limited.

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.960
AGS Support Facilities Ltd is a business

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.240
that provides two bespoke solutions
into supported housing.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.280
The first one is a concierge
and safeguarding service, which covers

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.480
our customers' homelessness,
accommodation properties

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.240
overnight and on weekends
when the support workers go home.

8
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.840
The second service
we offer is more of a recruitment offering

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.520
whereby we place staff
on temporary contracts to cover day shifts

10
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.680
such as support workers
recovery workers, reception

11
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.520
staff, etc..

12
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.680
We decided some time ago
that we wanted to make a change

13
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.600
to our fleet of vehicles
within our business.

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.120
So we approached Barclays

15
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.040
who were very helpful in helping us fund
some new electric vehicles.

16
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.120
Several benefits
we've noticed since moving across to

17
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
electric vehicles are the tax incentives
available for companies

18
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.280
who switch to electric vehicles
or fleets of electric vehicles.

19
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.240
The other thing

20
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.160
for us was obviously lowering our carbon
footprint and becoming more sustainable

21
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.200
as a business in terms of our CO2
emissions, etc..

22
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.600
Having been in business for 25 years,
I believe that business is all

23
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.000
about relationships.

24
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.400
Reciprocal relationships is obviously
the type of relationship you want,

25
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.080
but we're very, very fortunate to have
that sort of relationship with Barclays.

26
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.560
Our Relationship Manager
at Barclays is very responsive,

27
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.480
always available when we need them.

28
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.880
I believe that we all need
to make little changes to try

29
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.960
and protect our future
in terms of being more sustainable,

30
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.760
such as driving EVs,
switching the way we power our home

31
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.080
and just making little
changes across the board.

32
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.080
Sustainability doesn't need to be an insurmountable
challenge for businesses.

33
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.920
Our suggestion would be looking at it
in bite size chunks

34
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.400
and all the little changes
that you can make, make a difference.
