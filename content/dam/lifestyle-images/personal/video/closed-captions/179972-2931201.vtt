Online Banking. How to make a payment.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.080
It's easy to make a payment with Online Banking.

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.280
Firstly, make sure you have
a PINsentry device to hand.

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.760
If you don't have a physical PINsentry
and are registered for the Barclays app,

5
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.040
you can use mobile PINsentry
to authenticate your payments.

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.760
On the homepage

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.560
click on 'Pay'.

8
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.200
Then select the account you want to make
the payment from in the drop down menu.

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.360
Next, select who you'd like to make
the payment to an existing payee,

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.280
someone new or a company.

11
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.480
If you're paying a company
their details may automatically appear,

12
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.400
just start typing their name.

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.680
If you're paying someone new
add the name of the person you're paying

14
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.200
and their account details.

15
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.520
Once you've added all the details, we'll
check them with the recipient's bank.

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.840
If the details match, we'll
confirm the details are correct.

17
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.760
If the name doesn't match,
other responses may occur.

18
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.520
You can search 'Confirmation of payee'

19
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
on the Barclays website
for more information.

20
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.280
If the details match tap 'Continue'.

21
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.080
Next, enter the amount
of the payment you'd like to make.

22
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.160
Then tell us if you'd like to make
the payment now or at a later date.

23
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.720
Add a payment reference that you'll both

24
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.920
see on your account,
choose the 'Payment purpose'.

25
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.160
Then if you've read the information about

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.960

tick the box and then click, 'Continue.'

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.640
Make sure you have the correct card

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.000
that ends with the 4-digits that you
