WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.600
Welcome, everyone, and thank you so much
for joining us for our event today,

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.360
which will be focusing
on a really important topic.

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.760
We're currently in one of the busiest
shopping periods of the year,

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.720
but scammers are also busy coming up
with clever new tactics to convince us

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.080
to part with our personal
and our financial information.

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.240
UK Finance have recently published
their Fraud and Scams figures

7
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.720
for January to June 2023
and compared to the same period in 2022,

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.680
the number of scams report
have actually increased by 22%.

9
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.640
Now, one of the best tools
we have at our disposal

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.200
to protect ourselves from cyber criminals
is our ability to identify scams,

11
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.240
which in turn
will help us to avoid falling victim.

12
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.200
Now we understand that being targeted by

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
scammers
will impact us all in different ways.

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.320
So today, we wanted to give you
all the opportunity to tell us what's

15
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.400
on your mind by submitting questions
around fraud scams and cyber crime.

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.280
Through our scam, Ask the Experts event.

17
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.960
We're also

18
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.000
extremely lucky to be joined
by some industry experts

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.160
who will help to answer our questions
and will share insight into how

20
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.040
we can avoid falling victim
and ultimately beat the scammers.

21
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.120
So first of all, for myself,
my name is Paul Martin and I am part

22
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.720
of the Digital Eagles and Money
Mentor team here at Barclays Bank.

23
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.200
Our team are passionate
about helping people to enhance

24
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.760
their digital skills and also
to manage their money in a digital world.

25
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.000
I'm also looking to be joined by Ryan

26
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Pallett from our Scam investigation team.

27
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.960
He'll be providing us with insight
into the latest fraud

28
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.600
and scam trends and how we're proactively
supporting our customers

29
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.600
to protect themselves
through education and awareness.

30
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.040
And we'll also welcome Paul Maskall
from the dedicated card on Payment

31
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.320
Crime Unit

32
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.320
who will be sharing his knowledge
and expertise on the tactic,

33
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.920
techniques and psychology used by today's
criminals, and how changing

34
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.640
your mindset can actually reduce
the risk of falling victim.

35
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.560
Now, before we get started
with answering your questions today,

36
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.960
I wanted to come over
to both of our guest speakers

37
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.040
to share a little bit more insight
into the work that they're doing

38
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.440
and why, of course, this is so important.

39
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.040
So first of all, if we wouldn't mind
coming over to you, Paul.

40
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.680
Thanks, Paul.

41
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.440
And yeah,
good afternoon, everybody, and welcome.

42
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.880
And thank you very much
for being on the session today.

43
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.840
So I'm a little bit different.

44
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.960
I tend to come at it from a very much
more of a psychology point of view

45
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.120
and a perspective point of view
is that very often is that fraud

46
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.600
and scams is often seen as as an issue
that happens to other people.

47
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.200
Very often it's a crime type that people
fall for in these sorts of situations.

48
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.880
But what we often forget in these sorts
as a kind of context is that, well,

49
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.040
actually everybody's been told something
that they wanted to hear

50
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.440
at probably the wrong time,
that you should have heard it.

51
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.280
That could have been your last
relationship, your last job, your last

52
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.880
marriage.

53
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.000
It could have been 101 different contexts
as to how that happened.

54
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.680
And the problem is,
is that very often when it comes down

55
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.840
to the way the world works
now, from a society point of view, is that

56
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.200
we are very often on our technology
a lot where either through text

57
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.120
messages, through social media,
through emails, through phone calls,

58
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.160
we're both simultaneously more connected,
but also simultaneously more isolated.

59
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.000
And as Paul said,
we've seen this massive rise in scams

60
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.200
reporting
and these kind of different elements.

61
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200
And very often fraud is very often

62
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.200
expedited by the use of our technology.

63
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.120
So from my point of view,
I am one of the National Take

64
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.760
Five spokespeople and very often is
I can give you all of the education

65
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.240
in the world and I can give you
all of the top ten tips,

66
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.560
but unfortunately, I can't make you
any less emotional in the moment

67
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.680
and very often is that and
there is a flavor of fraud for everyone.

68
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.400
There's a flavor of scam for everyone,

69
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.960
no matter what your age is, who you are,
where you are, what your perspective

70
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.960
is, how confident or savvy
you believe you are.

71
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.800
And unfortunately, everybody is being told
something that they wants to hear.

72
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.400
So first of all, from a take
five point of view,

73
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.240
it is taking the three aspects
around stop, challenge and protect.

74
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.560
Because in any given situations,
if you having a contact, a text message

75
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.880
or an email like stop,
do you think that it could be a scam?

76
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.360
Is this legitimate?

77
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.440
Because if you now
think about today's world,

78
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.400
is there actually, in order to verify
who I am in any given situation,

79
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.360
I don't really need that much,
whether it's a product

80
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.320
or a piece of information or even if
I'm trying to impersonate somebody.

81
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.600
So first of all, stop it.
Take that moment.

82
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.840
And just like that argument you've had
with a partner or a family member,

83
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.440
taking that time to take a breather
to think, okay, well, hold on a second.

84
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.480
Am I really saying this in the right way?

85
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.520
Take letting that emotion
sort of cool down, but also challenge you,

86
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.880
challenge
the person on the other end of the phone

87
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.440
if they're a legitimate organization.

88
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.000
Very often it's about an online
being made sure that very often actually,

89
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.080
if they're Barclays, if they're a bank,
if they're law enforcement

90
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.080
or they're a telecoms company
or somebody an organization,

91
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.400
they're not going to have a problem with
you having that moment to say, you know

92
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.680
what, I think this could be a scam
or to have that piece of mind.

93
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.080
But very often
the third aspect is about protection.

94
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.440
So, again, stop, challenge and protect
that from a protect point of view.

95
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.240
If you do think you have been impacted
and targeted by a criminal

96
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.520
in these sorts of situations,

97
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.840
it is about contacting your bank
immediately

98
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.440
in order to have that rectified
or that then to assist you,

99
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.560
but also to contact action
fraud and report it.

100
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.200
So that is really the framework around
the Take five to Stop fraud campaign.

101
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.560
And again, is it's very often
it's about that emotional mindfulness.

102
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.760
And this is where it comes into, well,
how do I identify it in the first place?

103
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.160
How do I go about

104
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.240
if what is an email or a phishing text
or or something along those lines?

105
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.760
Well, I believe in what's called cause.

106
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.480
So it's very often C.A.

107
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.360
U. S. E.

108
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.400
And no matter what the flavor of fraud,
whether it is a Royal Mail scam,

109
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.680
whether it is a DPD parcel scam,
whether it's somebody talking to you

110
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.880
online or engaging with you through online
dating or any other platform,

111
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.920
is that generally speaking, as a criminal,
I will use a combination

112
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.120
of these five things,

113
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.480
potentially all four or five
or at least some weight on different ones.

114
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.080
So first of all, I'm going to use context.

115
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.000
So why is that
the reason I'm talking to you,

116
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.800
whether that be an investment opportunity,
whether that be I'm in love with you

117
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.600
or something along
those lines is very often the context is

118
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.320
really crucial for to give you a certain
element of, well, this is

119
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.920
this is a legitimate communication
because of this reason.

120
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.920
Now, very often it
then leads into elements of authority.

121
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.920
So hello, I'm from Barclays.

122
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.800
Hello, I'm from the police. Hello,
I'm from the NHS.

123
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.480
Hello, I'm from I don't know your telecoms
provider or something along those lines.

124
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.080
It's giving you that context,
but also giving you

125
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.440
a certain amount of trust
that I am who I say I am.

126
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.200
And you can trust me because I am
your organization in which you work with.

127
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.040
Now, very often people
turn around and say, Well,

128
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.240
I got contacted by a certain bank,
but I don't even bank with them.

129
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.560
Yes, but if I contact it, contact
150 people during that day

130
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.520
and only one person
actually does bank with that bank, then

131
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.440
that's a good return on my investment
from a criminal point of view.

132
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.520
So very often it's
high volume, low return,

133
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.720
but also urgency
in any of these given situations.

134
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.120
Very often I want to make you do something
very, very quickly.

135
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.320
So whether it's if you don't act now,
then this horrible bad thing will happen.

136
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.960
Or if you don't act now,

137
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.120
then very often it's this
you will lose out on the opportunity for.

138
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.640
So whether that's investments

139
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.840
or again, a problem with your account
or something along those lines,

140
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.920
generally speaking,
and a legitimate, legitimate organization

141
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.640
will not pressure you
in that kind of urgency on that tonality.

142
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.480
And again, being able
to challenge them and say, you know what,

143
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.280
this is not something that I'm comfortable
with and taking those payments.

144
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.920
But also scarcity.

145
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.760
Now scarcity, human beings, generally
speaking, when we look at the kind

146
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.440
of the high rise in in

147
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.760
again, the kind of

148
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.520
the time of year

149
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.640
where we're all wanting to buy Christmas
gifts, we're looking to get deals,

150
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.120
Black Friday is just past
the Christmas sales coming on, etc.

151
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.040
Very often
we are hardwired to overvalue scarcity.

152
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.640
So when you see a web website

153
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.440
saying, well, it's a limited time offer
for you to be providing this, fantastic.

154
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.480
Very often when it's only a few left
in stock, it provides

155
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.720
this kind of nudge to go,
I'll just buy that, or I'll get that.

156
00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.560
So very often criminals would use elements
of scarce scarcity to support

157
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.600
that and get us to commit

158
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.720
or to do something in those situations.

159
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.920
But more importantly
than all of these things,

160
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.920
and again, I will use a combination
of those first four,

161
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.480
but generally speaking,
I will absolutely weigh upon.

162
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.320
The emotional aspect is that very often
I will want to make you panicked.

163
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.240
I want to make you depressed.
I want you to make you anxious.

164
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.400
I want you to make you fearful
or I want to make you excited.

165
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.520
I want you to make you hopeful.

166
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.280
I want to make you again
in any of the spectrum of generally

167
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.240
want to use the two ends of the spectrum,
whether that be really positive feelings

168
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.280
or really negative feelings.

169
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.920
Because you know as well as I do,
we don't think

170
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.000
overly objectively when we are emotional.

171
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.320
So in these situations I'm reliant on
especially the urgency aspect.

172
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.200
I want to get you to do something

173
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.880
within that finite emotional window,

174
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.120
whether it is to give me

175
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.520
your information in your data,
or it might be to transfer some money

176
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.680
through a bank, transfer for a product
or for an opportunity or an investment,

177
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.240
or even to help out what you believe is
somebody that's

178
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.920
very close to you, especially in things
like romance scams as well.

179
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.520
So that emotion is really, really crucial.

180
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.800
And very often it's more of fraud
and scams

181
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.760
is much more about emotional mindfulness
than many other things because I can

182
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.320
give you all the education in the world,
but I cannot get you

183
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.480
to actually consciously take that moment
and think about those emotions as well.

184
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.880
So stop, challenge and protect.

185
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.320
And I'm looking forward
to answering those questions as well.

186
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400
Amazing and

187
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.640
thank you so much, Paul
and really insightful because we know

188
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.760
there is a lot of psychology
that goes into fraud and scams.

189
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.920
And one of the reasons why scams continue
to be such a problem is because scammers

190
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.200
have become really clever
at manipulating people into behaving

191
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.200
in a way
that they would always usually wouldn't.

192
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.880
So end some really good insight.

193
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.600
There am a great introduction to
the sessions and thank you so much, Paul.

194
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.640
And with that,
we're going to come over to you, Ryan,

195
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.080
if you wouldn't mind telling us
a little bit

196
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.320
more about the work
you do to help protect and educate people.

197
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.120
Yeah, of course.

198
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.200
And thank you again.

199
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.920
Like the other two had already said.

200
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.720
Thank you very much for joining us today.

201
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.640
So my name's Ryan and I'm
part of the fraud

202
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.640
and scams investigation
team here at Barclays.

203
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.760
So in a nutshell,
what my role ultimately is, is almost

204
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.960
first point of contact with customers
to ultimately try and protect themselves

205
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.680
from potentially falling victim to a scam

206
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.400
or potentially
fraud or something like that.

207
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.960
What we ultimately do within our role is
we will basically investigate a payment

208
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.760
that's been flagged on our fraud system
that it suspects is potentially fraudulent

209
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.080
or potentially something that is
maybe a risk

210
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.080
more than maybe usual payments
that you might potentially make.

211
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.400
This could be down
to a number of different things.

212
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.000
It could be sort of digital footprint
like what Paul mentioned a second ago.

213
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.520
It could be the fact that,

214
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.000
let's say for instance,
it can see that you're maybe transacting

215
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.840
in a different area
from what you usually do,

216
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.160
a different country,
something along those lines.

217
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.520
That would be a cause for our risk.

218
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.360
It could be the fact
that it's a larger amount

219
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.040
than what you usually potentially make.

220
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.800
What we ultimately need to do is
we need to come to a conclusion

221
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.800
as to whether the payment
is potentially genuine or not.

222
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And if we don't feel
we have enough evidence

223
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.440
to be able to do that,
we simply call the customer

224
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.720
and try and have a conversation
around the payments.

225
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.520
Now, what's involved in that is obviously

226
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.360
a number of detail questions,
and every agent along with myself,

227
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.560
we are specifically trained
to pick up on what we class is red flags.

228
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.400
So these could be sort of certain things
where maybe you've been forced

229
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.000
or pressured into making the payment
exactly like Paul mentioned a minute ago,

230
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.520
It could be something where you've made it
in promised a certain offer

231
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.800
or a return or something like that.

232
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.760
And you've been told
that if you don't make the payment

233
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.920
now, you're going to miss out
on the opportunity or something like that.

234
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.520
It could be the fact
that maybe you are making a purchase.

235
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.480
It's not like we set this target
time of year, very, very prevalent

236
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.040
for scammers to basically pick up on
potential purchase scams or forcing people

237
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.360
into trying to buy a specific item
is picking up on those conversations.

238
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.120
And those potential may be key sentences
that are said during the conversation.

239
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.840
So ultimately determine whether we believe
a payment is genuine or not.

240
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.720
Scammers, exactly like what we said
a minute ago,

241
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.280
are unfortunately adapting
and evolving every single day

242
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.360
to basically overcome
sort of certain situations and parameters

243
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.040
for for us to basically have to ultimately

244
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.720
come to that conclusion as to
whether it is, again, fraudulent or not.

245
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.400
This is a bank
we speak obviously with other banks

246
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.160
and we sort of discuss trends and patterns

247
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.160
and different scenarios
that we see quite frequently.

248
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.720
It could be a number of different things.

249
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.880
Like I mentioned,
it could be purchasing items,

250
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.920
it could potentially be cryptocurrency,
which is what we see a lot of recently.

251
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.080
There are so many different things
that we can potentially spot.

252
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.560
The sad truth is anyone it's actually
like what we said a second ago,

253
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.120
anyone can unfortunately be a victim
nowadays,

254
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.800
as much as like what we've said,
people can be more savvy and more aware

255
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.880
and we can we can try and educate people
as much as what we potentially can.

256
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.880
The reality is,
as things are ever changing, it's our duty

257
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.000
as a bank to try and provide
as much information for you,

258
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.080
our customers, to to basically try
and make sure that

259
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.080
we're giving you the opportunity
to take a step back,

260
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.760
realize if there is something that's
maybe not quite right.

261
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.640
And basically,

262
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.960
hopefully having that conversation
with you, maybe sometimes towards the

263
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.200
the sort of perception
as to whether it is real or not,

264
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.600
we do tend to use the term
breaking the spell.

265
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.160
And it's actually like
Paul mentioned a minute ago,

266
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.080
sometimes it is the emotional aspects

267
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.080
where we have to have
those difficult conversations with you.

268
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.960
We have to try and make sure
that obviously the situation

269
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.560
that you're in
is potentially not making you

270
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.000
sort of more susceptible to a scam
or to potentially becoming a victim.

271
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.120
But as I say, ultimately what my role is,
is to basically

272
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.440
stop those scams or prevent those payments
before they actually get released

273
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.040
for fraudulent purposes.

274
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.880
Along with that,
there is also part of my role to sort of

275
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.040
detect our own customers that we believe
are potentially fraudulent themselves

276
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.720
and basically raise a investigation
against those customers.

277
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.480
So ultimately
we can help protect our customers.

278
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:40.680
And those people at other banks, too, to
basically stop them from happening again.

279
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.240
Brilliant.

280
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.320
Thank you so much.

281
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:42.640
Ryan.

282
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.400
And again, it links perfectly
to what Paul thought was true earlier on.

283
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.600
We do know that fraudsters
do look to harvest people's

284
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.320
details using processes that are referred
to as social engineering.

285
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.960
And this is the act of tricking
someone into sharing information or taking

286
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.120
an action or, like Ryan mentioned,
just acting out of character.

287
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.640
But naturally, as technology evolves,
we have lots of channels

288
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.280
that are available for cybercriminals
to use to scam people.

289
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.560
That could be social media platforms,
dating applications, online marketplaces.

290
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.400
But I think the psychology and the tactics
are really important to understand.

291
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.440
As a starting point,
because scammers will prey on people

292
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.440
who are looking for
the best possible deals and exploit them.

293
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.960
They will create that sense of urgency
and try and force

294
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.960
people to make poor decisions.

295
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.800
And they will also harness
that sense of authority

296
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.000
to instead instill fear in their victims.

297
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.760
And I know this is very common
across a lot of their impersonation scams,

298
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.360
purchase scams that we're seeing them
at this time of year.

299
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.600
So we really do appreciate
that introduction and give us a bit

300
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.680
more context into the work
you do to educate and protect people.

301
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.480
But with that, we do have a few questions
that have come through that we would love

302
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.520
to get your thoughts on.

303
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.280
Now, the first one,
I think we will direct up Paul

304
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.520
So how do cyber criminals actually obtain
our details?

305
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.160
Has there been any link
made between signing up

306
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.280
to services and these compromisations?

307
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.640
And also when contacted by people
purporting to be these organizations,

308
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.280
how do we actually know
we're speaking to a genuine company?

309
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.280
I think it's interesting because again,
from a

310
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.360
from a data point of view
and how do they get our details now?

311
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.000
First of all, I have a question
and a kind of a reflection

312
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.080
is that if you see somebody armed
with a clipboard

313
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.320
in your local high street,
what do you do now?

314
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.080
Now, most people,
if you're anything like me,

315
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.760
will either do this
massive awkward semicircle

316
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.200
around them or that really awkward
eye contact said, no.

317
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.000
So I'm okay.

318
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.920
I'm very busy, I'm

319
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.880
doing something else, I'm walking
elsewhere, I'm shopping or whatever.

320
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.560
But actually very often
if I stop you and say, well, actually

321
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.520
why do you not want to talk
to this person?

322
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.960
There's like,
there's a number of different reasons.

323
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.920
You're busy, you're distracted,

324
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.560
you don't want to give your data
and information to this person.

325
00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.000
You don't necessarily feel comfortable

326
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.440
about giving your email information
now in in person in that sort of aspect.

327
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.920
But the problem is over the past,
probably about 20 years, maybe,

328
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.560
maybe even less,
is that we've been conditioned

329
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:17.000
to give our information and personal data
away for pretty much everything.

330
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.240
So whether that's an online account,
whether it's an online platform,

331
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.680
whether that's an online form or a 10%
offer from from a website, is that data

332
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.640
is incredibly valuable to organizations,
both legitimate and not legitimate.

333
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.920
And very often it's the case of where
because we have been conditioned

334
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.880
as a population for so many years
to give away our information,

335
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.560
is that how do cybercriminals
and fraudsters obtain

336
00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.760
the information while actually
incredibly easily so it's there's

337
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.120
still a situation where
whether it is through our own habits.

338
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.400
So if I say to you, when was the last time
you changed your personal email address

339
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.400
or when was the last time
you changed your personal mobile?

340
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.680
Now you I've just basically detailed

341
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.680
two of the main things
in which I contact you as a fraudster.

342
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.880
But if you haven't changed it

343
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.080
for a decade or two decades,
very often in some cases, is it?

344
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.400
I'm not saying change them,
but it's just that exposure over time

345
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.600
and also the amount of our accounts
and things like that we fill in

346
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.240
is it increases the amount of data
that we've ended up giving away.

347
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.800
So every time you fill in an online form
or an account, etcetera,

348
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.240
you are trusting that organization
to look after your data.

349
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.320
Unfortunately, some organizations
have found things like data breaches,

350
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.800
so data breaches have kind of exposed
that to a lot of organizations.

351
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.160
Data has been
then released into the public sphere,

352
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.280
again from a data breach point of view,
but also from a social engineering

353
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.120
point of view.

354
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.400
If I give you a 10% offer
or open an account or send you an email,

355
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.520
for information

356
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.160
that social engineering aspect is because
we've been conditioned to give it away,

357
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.200
we don't necessarily
have any sort of intuitive emotional

358
00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.040
hook to say, well, who is it
that I'm giving this information to?

359
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:05.840
So very often we give it away in when when
ask to in in very limited circumstances.

360
00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.960
So it's that aspect of both
the social engineering.

361
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.000
Again, the aspects around data breaches,
but also we actively put our data out

362
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.280
most of the time through things
like social media.

363
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.760
So when I used to work in law enforcement
and I still do in various guises,

364
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.120
but I also work for UK finance
and the dedicated card and payment crime

365
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.640
unit, it highlights the fact that actually
all the training in the world

366
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.480
that that showed me the ability
to find data, information about somebody.

367
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.560
Turns out you don't need any training.

368
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.160
It's incredibly easy and accessible.

369
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.640
So it's about understanding
this conscious choice of who you are

370
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.640
giving the data away
and when who you're engaging with it,

371
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.920
especially online
through its online portals and accounts.

372
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.520
But also how do you know
when it's a genuine company?

373
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.400
Well, sometimes you don't
in these sorts of situations,

374
00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.400
it is about stopping challenging
that information and not necessarily

375
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.520
taking it at face value
and being able to confirm in other ways.

376
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.080
So whether it's a purchase company
or online will actually look for reviews

377
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.800
and look for these sorts of situations.

378
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.400
But also if it's an organization
like Barclays, you're able to then

379
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.440
actually,
you know what, I'm going to call you back.

380
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.840
I'm going to engage with you.

381
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.080
I'm going to use the number
that I already have

382
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.760
in order to contact that organization
and do so through another means.

383
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.320
So very often to ensure that we are
genuinely talking to the people we want to

384
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.640
normally takes a little bit
more action on our side, unfortunately.

385
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.040
Brilliant and really insightful and again,
it seems to emphasize just how busy

386
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.320
those cyber criminals are coming up
with a variety of different ways

387
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.680
to harvest personal and financial details.

388
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.080
So just following on from that question,
another one that's

389
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.160
come through in the chat is,
is there anything individuals can do

390
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.480
to proactively protect their data
from cyber attacks?

391
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.720
Well, do the kind of in-person test,

392
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.040
because if I came up to you in the middle
of the street with that clipboard

393
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.880
just out of the blue completely
and just said, can I have all of your

394
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.720
personal information?

395
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.640
Can I want

396
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.640
to know your name, your date of birth,
your address,

397
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.320
everything about you, and potentially

398
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.320
maybe your National insurance number
to boot as well.

399
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.120
Now, if I was to do that
in the middle of the street,

400
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.400
what would your response be?

401
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.400
Now in these sorts of situations
is that very often

402
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.600
you have this kind of defensiveness.

403
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.480
I'm like,
No, I'm not giving you the information.

404
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.560
Why would I give that information to you?

405
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.520
But online, we don't have face,
we don't have space,

406
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.200
we don't have context.

407
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.880
We don't have that sort of intuitive
hook of somebody randomly coming up to us.

408
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.000
But that's exactly what happens
in a social media direct message.

409
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.400
That's exactly
what happens in a social media advert.

410
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.560
It's exactly
what happens in a phishing email.

411
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.880
For instance, if I'm contacting
or if I randomly phone you.

412
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.360
So very often
it is the equivalent of me just running up

413
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.360
to you in the street with a clipboard
and asking you for that information.

414
00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.760
So it's very often is like, Well,

415
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.760
do you feel comfortable
about giving this information to them?

416
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.360
So very often it's
that mindful process of going,

417
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.120
well, actually, do I trust this person?

418
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.560
Is this is this somebody who I can trust
in these given situations?

419
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.280
So that is the best advice
because unfortunately, in today's world,

420
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.560
asking you to never give out your data
to anyone is basic.

421
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.760
The equivalent of asking you
to live under a rock in a cave somewhere.

422
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.200
And fortunately, because if you do,
you want to buy anything or do anything,

423
00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.200
then unfortunately
it is the nature of the beast.

424
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.720
But very often it is taking that moment.

425
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.120
Do I trust who I'm talking to.

426
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.640
Do I trust this message?

427
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.320
Do I trust this contact?

428
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:45.360
And if so, how do I confirm that trust
and how am I able to get that data away?

429
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.080
Yeah, absolutely brilliant.

430
00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.040
I think that ties
into a lot of the questions

431
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.560
we have actually seen coming
through in the chat mentioned.

432
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.640
And you know, when we complete online
forms or we enter online competitions

433
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.840
and we're naturally asked

434
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.760
to put a lot of information in that
can include things like date of birth.

435
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.680
So I think the message there is clear
it really just take that time,

436
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.120
do research,
check for the organizations that you're in

437
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.240
that you're actually utilizing
or about your thinking of doing business

438
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.240
with and also getting in contact
with them through genuine channels.

439
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.640
But if you're unsure, the best thing to do
is probably to avoid sharing

440
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.400
that information
for risk of being targeted by criminals.

441
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.440
So that is brilliant.

442
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.040
So thank you so much for that. Paul.

443
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.160
So with that, I think
can we come over to Ryan next?

444
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.240
We do get a couple of questions
through that.

445
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.600
We think, why am I perfectly to the work
that you and your team do?

446
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.080
Ryan So when we have a question
that mentions that they receive

447
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.120
a large number of texts
that claim to be from organizations

448
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.640
like the Royal Mail, HMRC, etc.,

449
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.680
so who do we actually report these to?

450
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.840
So realistically
you can kind of report them to us

451
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.320
if you have potentially fallen victim
to one of these yourself.

452
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.400
So the trouble is, is
they look so realistic

453
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.400
and especially this time of year,

454
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.560
you can also report them too.

455
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.520
Obviously the Stop Think Fraud

456
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.480
at those at the top of organizations
and stuff like that

457
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.320
from if you're looking at it from a
from a bank perspective, like I say,

458
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.200
especially at this time of year,
that's so, so prevalent

459
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.760
because the reality is everyone's
expecting parcels this time of year.

460
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.000
Everyone's sort of buying
gifts and presents and whatever else

461
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.640
it would be for family and friends
and that type of stuff.

462
00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.520
So there's sort of a few things to
to kind of watch out for.

463
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.880
So first sort of main thing would be
the reality is a lot of these ones,

464
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.680
especially from like the Royal Mail or DPD
or these other

465
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.000
sort of courier sites or company sorry,

466
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.680
there'll always sort of in always
be something along the lines of

467
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.240
you need to pay X amount for a

468
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.240
release fee for your parcel or something
along those lines.

469
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.800
The reality is you will never be asked
by these companies to pay

470
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.080
a small release fee.

471
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.640
Air Quotes “Release fee”

472
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.480
because if you've bought the product
from a legitimate merchant, so let's say

473
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.400
you bought it from Boots or John Lewis
or whoever else it would be,

474
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.360
they will always add the
the postage to the actual final bill.

475
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.800
So you should never be paying
an additional amount on top of that.

476
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.240
So there's a few things to sort of spot.

477
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.520
The first thing,
especially if you get it from a

478
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.720
an actual email, is check the actual
email itself.

479
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.840
So check the email
because nine times out of ten a guarantee,

480
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.720
you check the actual email where you

481
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.200
when you type on the actual email itself
or the name of who it's been sent from

482
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.040
and it will be nothing to do
with the Royal Mail

483
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.040
or nothing to do with HMRC or something
along those lines.

484
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.280
Most of the time it's actually quite funny
because it does actually

485
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.440
have someone's actual name.

486
00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.520
So the scammers actual name in the email

487
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.400
followed by maybe a load of numbers
or digits or something.

488
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.960
The other thing that you can also do is
if you get it from a text or again,

489
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.920
if it is an email,

490
00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.280
have a look at the grammar
and the punctuation and stuff like that.

491
00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.280
Because sometimes what you will find
is when you're reading it,

492
00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.720
don't randomly be sort of a double spacing
or an extra letter

493
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.160
or one of the words will be spelt wrong
or something like that.

494
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.560
Now I'm not saying go away and, and read
in detail every single one of these,

495
00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.120
but if you look and it just doesn't look
right straight off, right off the bat then

496
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.240
obviously there's cause for concern
that what we would advise is

497
00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.360
if you ever have potentially
submitted details to one of these,

498
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.000
like what we mentioned a minute ago,
call your bank as soon as you can,

499
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
because the reality is the faster
you get in contact with the bank

500
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.600
and the quicker

501
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.920
you let us know, the quicker
we can ultimately do something about it.

502
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.800
So if you've potentially contacted
or given out information to one of these

503
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.160
one of these sort of texts
or emails or whatever it would be,

504
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.720
simply call us, because it might be a case
that we may need to reissue a new card

505
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.160
to you or something like that,
because maybe you've given out

506
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.840
the long number on your card
or whatever else it would be.

507
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.360
But the reality is,

508
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.240
especially this time of year,
these are always all over the place.

509
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.400
And it's not just the HMRC or Royal Mail
It could be anyone.

510
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.160
Funnily enough, I had one from the DVLA.

511
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.280
I know that my car tax was coming up soon,
so there you go.

512
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.480
I'm looking at that straight away
thinking could it be genuine?

513
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.520
Like say, stop, have a look at it,

514
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.960
do a little bit of investigation
and it's still not entirely sure.

515
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.280
And like I say, there are websites out
there, even our own Barclays website,

516
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.320
if you did want to have a look at what
to sort of look for in order

517
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:29.120
to try and protect yourself
a little bit further.

518
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:29.800
Brilliant.

519
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.240
Thank you very much Ryan.

520
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.040
I think that actually leads perfectly
into our next question.

521
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.840
So legitimate calls
from financial institutions like Barclays,

522
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.760
for example, and those fraud teams
can sometimes seem suspicious.

523
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.320
Can they be linked to some sort of a code
within the Barclays

524
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.280
mobile banking app to clarify
that they are actually real?

525
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.040
Yeah, definitely.

526
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.000
So it's actually a really good question
because

527
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.960
most of us are taught
that if you ever receive a call

528
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.520
from from “the bank”,
then it's probably suspicious

529
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.120
or you've probably got cause for concern
or something like that.

530
00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.120
That's just typically
how everyone's raised is

531
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.080
if we ever get something
like that, ignore it.

532
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.400
What we would always try and do,
at least from from a Barclays

533
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.800
perspective, is
we will always try and take you through

534
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.800
If we do potentially need
to make outbound calls yourself.

535
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.840
So like I say, that's what I do.

536
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.160
If we have a duty to contact you,
we will simply always try and take you

537
00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.600
through security using the Barclays
Mobile Banking app.

538
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.960
So you don't need to give us any details.

539
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.680
You don't need to give us your card

540
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.480
details or answer security questions
or something like that.

541
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.080
We will always try and do that
where possible.

542
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.920
And it's simply a case of just sending
a notification to the app and it'll say,

543
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.440
you've got a call from Barclays.

544
00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.200
You're speaking with Brian.
Is it you on the call?

545
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.240
And you just simply confirm
that and it allows us to continue our call

546
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.440
without having to actually divulge
any personal information

547
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.800
or like we mentioned, given
our email addresses and stuff like that.

548
00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.680
The other thing

549
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.200
as well is like
what Paul mentioned earlier is

550
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.920
we will never, ever try and put
you under pressure to continue the call.

551
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.120
So if you ever receive a call
from the bank

552
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.520
or from someone claiming to be
from the bank, we would never turn around.

553
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.240
You would say, Well,
you have to continue this call.

554
00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.880
Otherwise these funds are going to get
released or something along those lines.

555
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.160
You never get that.

556
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.720
What we would simply advise you
is if you don't feel comfortable

557
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.880
on the call, call us back on
a legitimately sourced number.

558
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.960
So the numbers

559
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.120
on the back of your actual debit card,
the number from the official bank website,

560
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.960
so from the official Barclays website
or something like that, we will never try

561
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.680
and force you to continue with the call
because as I mentioned at the beginning,

562
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.080
it's it's talk

563
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:46.440
that you
should never get a call from the bank.

564
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.360
Yeah, that's absolutely brilliant.

565
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.480
Ryan really insightful

566
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.840
and I think it links back a lot to what
Paul mentioned earlier on.

567
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.760
If we are unsure, we take that time,
we do our research and we contact

568
00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.920
those organizations through a channel
that we absolutely know to be genuine.

569
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.040
And it's great
that some of those digital tools

570
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:07.880
can actually be used to help people
in those situations.

571
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.480
Excellent.

572
00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.760
So I think now
we will come back over to Paul.

573
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.880
I've got a couple on True Paul

574
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.200
that I think might be brilliant
for you to share some insight on.

575
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.560
So we've heard a lot about remote access
on malicious software recently.

576
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.440
If someone gets access to your computer
and you are of course aware of it,

577
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.320
what steps can you take to cut them off
as quickly as possible?

578
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.200
So there's two parts to this.

579
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.920
One is that the first part is, again,
any device,

580
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.560
for instance, again,
if you're on a computer, for instance,

581
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.800
is a first of all having, say,
for instance, antivirus and firewall,

582
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.120
whether that's the free version

583
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.120
that say for instance, comes with Windows
or different platforms,

584
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.320
having something like that
installed on your computer,

585
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.280
whether it is the free version
or, again, the paid for version.

586
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:51.760
Generally speaking,

587
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.840
I like a paid full version
because it comes with a number

588
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.200
of a suite of other security
softwares, etc..

589
00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.360
So very often it comes down to the fact
that actually having those sorts of things

590
00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.440
in place at the time is incredibly good.

591
00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.840
Also make sure that, for instance,
if you you're an iOS device or an Apple

592
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:12.360
device, for instance, or an iPad
or any device, always keep them updated.

593
00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.240
So nine times out of ten,
pretty much all updates require

594
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.320
or are included
with some sort of security update.

595
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.560
So, for instance, a vulnerability
in software or a vulnerability

596
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.760
in the hardware, etc..

597
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.400
So very often keeping these things
on automatic update, for instance,

598
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.840
from a public point of view is really,
really good to keep that security going.

599
00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.160
Now, again, that's great, but generally
speaking, sometimes from a remote access

600
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.760
software or malware, it's required on us

601
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.200
to be vigilant as well on top of it,
unfortunately.

602
00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.840
So very often if I send you an email
or a text message or

603
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.040
or trying to get you to take an action
on a link or a website,

604
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.800
very often then I can download
some sort of malicious software

605
00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.160
or indeed remote access software
directly onto my computer.

606
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.320
Now having the antivirus and firewall
and also updated machines

607
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.120
in the first place
will go a long way to to again being

608
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.120
you're almost your last line of defense
if you have clicked on that link.

609
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.840
It's also the advice that Ryan gave

610
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.640
you is around on trying to avoid
going onto those links in the first place.

611
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.280
But when it comes to it,
if you've actually got to the point

612
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.040
where it's now happening,
is that especially for remote access

613
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.760
software, very often criminals,
especially in things like investment scams

614
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.000
and they will
I will guide you through the process.

615
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.080
So if you go to this website, say,
for instance, teamviewer or a number of

616
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.000
different products out there as well,
they are completely legitimate platforms.

617
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.720
The software
you're your platform, your your antivirus

618
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.720
won't flag it because it's again,
legitimate software

619
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.920
used for things like it support
and all these sorts of things.

620
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.200
So they are used.

621
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.080
But the problem is it gives
whoever is actually kind

622
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.920
of directing that individual
complete access over the computer.

623
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.160
So very often
I will guide you through the process,

624
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.440
but actually in the background
I could be taking information, taking

625
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.440
data, downloading
something on the app on your computer,

626
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.960
something along those lines.

627
00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.320
So if you do get to that point,

628
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.800
unfortunately,
it does come down to the fact that if you

629
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.960
then realize, hold on a second,
something's going on,

630
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.320
you don't have necessarily direct access
over your computer at that moment.

631
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.920
So very often
it is turning off the computer because

632
00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:29.800
you want to get shut access to that person
as quickly as humanly possible.

633
00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.560
Or it could be
if you're closer to the router, cut

634
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.760
the router off, etc.,
to be able to stop the connection.

635
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.040
If you are literally in that moment
of realization of going holding the second

636
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.320
somebody's done it, if you've got malware
downloaded on your platform,

637
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.320
it's about running a scan
with your antivirus and firewall systems.

638
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.800
And again
depending on the severity of the malware,

639
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.680
then you may need to get support
for that as well.

640
00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.080
But generally speaking is that

641
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.600
I am still going back to
the C.A.U.S.E was going back

642
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.080
to the Context of Authority,
Urgency, Scarcity and Emotion

643
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.040
is that that's how I'm going to get you
to download it in the first place.

644
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.960
So in those moments is yes,
we've seen lot of these rises

645
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.560
of different malware and ransomware
and all these sorts of things.

646
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.000
But generally speaking,
it does come down to that emotional

647
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.360
mindfulness in the first place
because our intuitions

648
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.200
doesn't necessarily have a great deal
to go on in those moments.

649
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.880
So it's about stopping.

650
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.800
Brilliant. Thank you, Paul. And again,

651
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.360
very insightful and great advice
on how to protect ourselves

652
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.640
and become more aware of things
like suspicious links, fake websites

653
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.760
and of course, malicious software
and should use following of not both.

654
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.640
Further advice can we give to protect
vulnerable individuals from scams?

655
00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.840
Because as we've seen already,
just in this session

656
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.800
alone, how much we've covered off.

657
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.880
But when we look at all
the different types of scams

658
00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:54.160
out there, impersonation
scams, purchase scams, money, mules,

659
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.400
what can we do to support
maybe those different age demographics

660
00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.240
or people who may be too trusting
of these types of contacts?

661
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.040
Yeah, I think first of all, it's
about realizing that

662
00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.120
we if we are human being,

663
00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.120
if you are a human being,
you are vulnerable to scams.

664
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.000
Unfortunately, is that very often
we have this kind of overconfidence

665
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.200
that it isn't just elderly people,
it isn't just well,

666
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.240
it is purely on the basis
that after probably nigh on nine years

667
00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.880
of looking into the behavioral science
around online manipulation, online

668
00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.000
scams, social engineering, I realized
that actually we're all susceptible.

669
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.720
We've all been, like I said before,

670
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.400
we've all been told something that we
wanted to hear at probably the wrong time.

671
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:45.040
And especially in an online environment,
we we often project our own feelings.

672
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.600
So for instance, in things like romance
scams, what am I really exploiting?

673
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.560
Well, actually I'm lonely and isolated.

674
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.760
I feel depressed. I can be anxious.

675
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.520
I can be I have a number of emotions
that are going on for me.

676
00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.840
I might be isolated from my family
or these or situations,

677
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.800
but very often somebody coming
out of the blue and going, You know what?

678
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.800
I think you're incredible.
I want to spend my life with you.

679
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.760
That that can be incredibly powerful
and very often is that.

680
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.960
Have you ever had a friend

681
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.600
that has been in a relationship
that they shouldn't be in?

682
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.880
Have you tried to tell them?

683
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.840
Again,
it's an incredibly challenging situation

684
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.920
and that is no different
to what Ryan was talking about in relation

685
00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.960
to what we try and do from a banking
point of view in, you know what?

686
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.040
This is the point
where you're transferring money.

687
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.080
This is the point where we believe
that this could be a scam.

688
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.360
And very often
people will be in that situation

689
00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.680
where they go, I'm in love
with the person.

690
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.440
I'm I'm I'm involved
in an incredibly investment opportunity.

691
00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.680
I want to buy this product.

692
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.560
Why should I believe otherwise?

693
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.920
So in these sorts of situations is it's
first of all, realizing that we are

694
00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.440
vulnerable and human beings aren't great
at admitting that most of the time.

695
00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.600
But this is very much the case
and that's the first real step.

696
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.840
But on top of that is that again,

697
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.480
think about the level of trust
that we can have in our information.

698
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:11.040
So whether it's an online product
or a holiday or all these sorts of things,

699
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.880
I only really need an image

700
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.240
that I could have stolen
from anywhere else on the Internet,

701
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.080
put it onto a marketplace or social media,

702
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.800
and then basically, you know, this
this much.

703
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.520
So very often it's the case where
actually there's very little verification

704
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.800
needed for that.

705
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.240
So very often it's having that kind
of healthy level of cynicism, realizing,

706
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.000
how do I go about making this trust
much stronger?

707
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.440
How do I that's terrible English,
but you know what I mean?

708
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.400
But it's again, it's about verifying.

709
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.680
It's trusting
and verifying in those situations.

710
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.440
And very often things like again,

711
00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.600
when we are asked to give away access
to whether it's our information, our data,

712
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.360
but also often it's
about our bank accounts as well.

713
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.080
And so in recent years
we've seen a massive rise

714
00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.480
in what's called money mules.

715
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.000
So individuals who have relinquished
a certain amount of control

716
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.800
over their bank accounts

717
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.680
and allow criminals
to essentially launder and funnel

718
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:12.240
the funds into those bank accounts
and utilize them for criminal purposes.

719
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.640
Now, some people,

720
00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.880
some people that we arrest will have 45,
50 banking apps on their phone.

721
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.480
They're completely witting
in these sorts of situations.

722
00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.480
They are a criminal in and of themselves
and they facilitate it.

723
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:28.320
But actually the grand majority of people
that are unwitting in these situations,

724
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.280
they're being groomed,
they're being coerced in these situations.

725
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.400
They may have been incentivized
with gift cards or money

726
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.400
or a percentage of it
to give access away from it as well.

727
00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:42.200
So very often it is about can
you can't go through life without trusting

728
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:47.040
some people, but it's also about verifying
that trust in the first place.

729
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:47.680
Amazing.

730
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.040
Thank you so much, Paul.

731
00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.160
And again, one really important topic
that you touched on there

732
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.880
was that element of money
muling in particular.

733
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.200
And this might be one for you, Ryan, that
you could share a bit more insight on.

734
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:03.200
If you do inadvertently facilitate money
laundering,

735
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.880
can you actually be prosecuted for that?

736
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.400
Yeah.

737
00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.120
So it is a really good one and it comes
down exactly to what Paul just mentioned.

738
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.120
So it's the whole witting or unwitting
scenario.

739
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.320
The reality is,
at least from a banking perspective,

740
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.520
it all comes down to how much does

741
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.200
that the Money Mule in terms of let's say

742
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.000
it was a Barclays customer,
actually realized what they're doing

743
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.600
because it's actually what
we've just mentioned a lot of the time.

744
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.400
They don't realize
what's actually happening.

745
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.560
They've given someone else access
to their account in order

746
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.200
for maybe a quick payoff or it's with what
we said, maybe some little bit of money

747
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.760
left behind in the account after it's
all said and done or something like that.

748
00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:50.040
The reality is if someone is
is sort of found

749
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.360
unwitting, ultimately what we need to do
is it's education more than I think.

750
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.160
So if we if we come across the situation
where we'd have to investigate

751
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.120
the customer, we've looked at them
and we've said, you know what,

752
00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.840
this doesn't quite look right.

753
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.560
We will have a thorough,
thorough investigation into them

754
00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.080
and we'll basically come up with
an outcome if we deem it to be unwitting,

755
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.760
we will still close their account.

756
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.280
So we will close their account
with us as a bank

757
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.920
because it's potentially a risk
to business.

758
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.560
It's a risk if a customer basically.

759
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.120
But the reality is more often than not,
it's more down to the education.

760
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.720
So it's making that customer aware
of what they've done,

761
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.440
that it's obviously illegal
because sometimes they don't even realize

762
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.320
what they're doing is actually illegal.

763
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.960
And and then it kind

764
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.000
of goes from there
if you're looking at it on the other side.

765
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.760
So you're looking at where we have clear
evidence that they are witting think

766
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.280
they are fully aware
of what they're doing.

767
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.600
All that type of stuff
is simply a case of close

768
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.080
their account down straightaway

769
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.800
and we ultimately upload them
onto a fraud database to basically

770
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.440
let the other banks know
that this person is fraudulent.

771
00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.400
This person has been found
to a bit of possession or in the in

772
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:04.000
the process of trying to move fraudulent
funds in and out of their account.

773
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.240
And then basically
it has a massive knock on effect

774
00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:12.080
because if you are found to be witting
and to be found as an actual mule,

775
00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.840
you potentially are not going to be able
to get anything

776
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.880
like a mortgage or open up another account
or something like that.

777
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.520
And the reality is with a lot of these

778
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.600
people that are unwitting,
they do tend to be the younger customer.

779
00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:30.000
And the reality is when they kind of get
recruited into these type of situations,

780
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.480
they don't realize what the repercussions
are of them actually being part of this.

781
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.080
So that's why the education of
this is so important

782
00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.680
in making them aware
of what does actually happen,

783
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.680
what is the process
and what can ultimately be the outcome.

784
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.280
If they do carry on doing this,

785
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:50.480
it can have such a such a big impact
on them later on in life.

786
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.000
Really?

787
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.960
Ryan, I think I think that really links
back to everything

788
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.240
that we have mentioned in that session
today.

789
00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.960
It's all about the education
piece building and expanding our knowledge

790
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.520
because that's going to better equipped
us to be able to identify and of course

791
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.480
avoid falling victim
to these types of fraud and scams.

792
00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.040
So that is absolutely brilliant
that we have a lot of different questions

793
00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.760
coming in around things like
cryptocurrency and social media platforms.

794
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.880
So I think one I'd love to get some more
insight from your self on Ryan, would be

795
00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.360
I get a lot of messages on social media
to invest in cryptocurrencies.

796
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.520
So do we get many reports of people
being scammed in that way?

797
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.800
Yeah, absolutely.

798
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.560
So when we talk about trends and stuff

799
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.480
that sort of occurs more often than not
and that type of stuff,

800
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:43.280
cryptocurrency at the minute is
one of the biggest ones that we're seeing.

801
00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.320
The reality is, is cryptocurrency

802
00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.080
in the grand scheme of things,
is actually still very, very new.

803
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.120
So yes, it's
been around close to a decade,

804
00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.280
but if you're looking at it
from its popularity,

805
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.840
I guess if you're looking at it from
that perspective, it's very, very new.

806
00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.440
And the reality is a lot of people

807
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.280
don't know the full ins and outs, myself
included.

808
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.400
I know enough from my role,
but if you were to turn around to me

809
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.480
tomorrow and say, What about X, Y, Z,
what should I be investing in?

810
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.840
I'm no expert in that.

811
00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:18.360
But what we do see is a lot of crypto
scams that are coming in

812
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.320
and also it's how to spot them.

813
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.160
So what I mentioned
kind of at the beginning of this is

814
00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.560
most often than not what we see
with cryptocurrency

815
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:31.040
scams is where a customer is being given
almost something.

816
00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.560
And it's a phrase that we use a lot is,
is it too good to be true?

817
00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.480
So we probably hear that a lot in life
and sometimes it can come across

818
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.520
as a bit of a negative thing.

819
00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.760
But the reality is
if you're being promised

820
00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.280
a return on your investment, that is,
they're saying they're going to triple,

821
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.080
quadruple, whatever it would be
your investment in a matter of days.

822
00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.640
The reality is that is not the case
with a cryptocurrency investment.

823
00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.360
What we are finding,
what we've come across recently is

824
00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.120
you'll be asked
or contacted through social media.

825
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.720
So you might see an advertisement
through it, through, let's

826
00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.560
say, Instagram, for instance.

827
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.800
You contact them and then you'll actually
get a call from the scammer saying,

828
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.400
Send money to this account
or open up your account

829
00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.400
and this cryptocurrency platform
or whatever it would be.

830
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.280
And then basically they'll get you
to deposit a small amount of money.

831
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.720
So this could be anything from £10,
£20, £30, whatever it would be.

832
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.360
And what they would do
is they will transfer you back,

833
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.680
say 60, 70, £80 or something like that.

834
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:36.080
So from the consumer's perspective,
you'll be looking at that thinking,

835
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.280
my God,
I've just made a double on my investment

836
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.480
in a matter of days
or something like that.

837
00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.760
That's how they'll get you.

838
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.280
And then basically they'll say, Right now,
put in more and you might put in 200

839
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.280
or 300, 400, a thousand,
whatever it would be,

840
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.080
and that's when they will take that money.

841
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.920
Another thing that we do see
is when it comes to that point as well,

842
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.280
you start getting contacted by these
these quote unquote,

843
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:04.080
financial advisers who have basically been
helping you make this payment

844
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.080
and now
basically say you need to send them

845
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.560
a fee in order to get your return
on your investment or something like that.

846
00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.440
This is a common trick that's that's used
especially in the investment world

847
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.280
or the investment scams world
from what I see personally.

848
00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:21.120
So it's definitely something
to keep an eye out,

849
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.360
especially, especially,

850
00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.800
like I said, when you're getting it in
for the first time,

851
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.280
one of the things that we do
typically say to our customers

852
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.960
is how much research
have you actually done into this?

853
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.640
What you, the one has actively
sought the investment,

854
00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.640
or if you've been contacted by someone
about the investment,

855
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.880
Because if he's getting told
that someone's contacted

856
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:45.080
you about the investment, that is what we
what we would claim is a red flag.

857
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:45.680
Brilliant.

858
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.000
Thank you very much, Ryan.

859
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.280
So again,
I think the key thing to remember

860
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.280
not only with cryptocurrencies
but what any type of investment will be,

861
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.800
definitely need to do that research
to seek independent financial advice

862
00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.360
before investing any money
because those investments

863
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.600
can obviously decrease
as well as increase them.

864
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.440
When you add in that extra element of
is this potentially a scam

865
00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.880
doing those checks and making sure
the companies are actually regulated

866
00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.360
to provide those products is such
an important topic and a step to take.

867
00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.640
And just before we go on
to our last couple of questions

868
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.080
Paul,
I just want to come back over to yourself

869
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.960
to see if you have anything
that you'd like to add

870
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.720
in on those investment
and cryptocurrency scams.

871
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.640
Yeah, of course, because I think

872
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.520
especially a cryptocurrency investment
scam is that they work

873
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.800
very much in the same way
as any other investment scams.

874
00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.920
So we've seen things like fine wine
scams, we've seen whiskey barrel scams,

875
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.920
we've seen gold bullion scams, we've seen

876
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.320
basically in asset class here,
basically in relation to investments,

877
00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.680
depending
on what's going on in the economy,

878
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.960
depending on
what's going on in the media, in the news,

879
00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.920
generally speaking, they're incredibly
good at making it contextually relevant

880
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.040
to what's going on in the world,
and especially with crypto over the last 2

881
00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.280
to 3 years.

882
00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.560
It's kind of shot up in that kind
of saturation in the environment as well.

883
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:04.280
But from a criminal side, this is again
from Ryan was talking about in relation

884
00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.080
to that impact and that people don't
necessarily know the mechanics behind it,

885
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.880
but also I'm reliant on that as a criminal
because you know what actually,

886
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.520
although the grand majority of crypto is

887
00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:19.200
is very much legitimate, there's different
working processes for it.

888
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.280
The different applications
I train a lot of the banks

889
00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.320
and law enforcement in crypto,
but generally speaking, it

890
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.920
reduces the need,
the ability for me to be found.

891
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.200
So generally speaking, if I've invested
and I put a load into crypto from a from a

892
00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.720
from fraud point of view,
from a criminal gains point of view,

893
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.800
it's it's a little harder
to investigate to

894
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.560
and to be able to identify.

895
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.040
So very often in these situations
is that I'm relying on

896
00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.280
cryptocurrency has a both

897
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.880
a brilliant fantastic thing that
the victim doesn't know what's going on

898
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.720
and they don't know the mechanics
and they don't

899
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.200
necessarily
have the avenues to do that research.

900
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.600
But actually on the other side
is it means that I can actually launder

901
00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.960
my money
in a much more effective fashion on crypto

902
00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.040
because if you transfer money to the wrong
a bank account,

903
00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.800
you have an institution to be able to help
you get your money back.

904
00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:14.040
Crypto, once it's gone, it's gone.

905
00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.080
It's there's
there's no there's no repercussions.

906
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.440
There's no overarching organization
that can say, you know what,

907
00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.920
we will get your crypto back.

908
00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.160
No, that's not how it works.

909
00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:27.720
Unfortunately.

910
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.280
Brilliant.

911
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.960
Thank you so much, Paul.

912
00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.240
Again,
I think that's that's just so important.

913
00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.400
The key thing to remember

914
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:38.040
there is if those deals or offers
sell good to be true, they probably are.

915
00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:42.280
And that is often going to make victims
less inclined to properly question

916
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.040
their own decisions as they may be focused
on, you know, getting that product

917
00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:50.160
or service for the best possible deal
or growing their assets when investing.

918
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.600
So again, just a really kind of solid
message from us all would be

919
00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:57.800
that when considering taking out any types
of financial products or services,

920
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:03.480
always do seek that independent
financial advice prior to doing so.

921
00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.920
So I think a

922
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:08.120
theme that we it off
today, guys, was purchase scams.

923
00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:11.880
And naturally with this time of year it's
absolutely applicable.

924
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.960
So just before we closed off
all of the session and share

925
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.600
some resources with our audience,
I suppose kind of I'd

926
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.240
just like to recap any of those key points
that you would like to share

927
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.040
with how we actually avoid falling
to purchase scams.

928
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.880
And we'll also see if we can
and we can get one

929
00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.520
or two more questions in there
then as well.

930
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.640
So I think from a purchase scam
point of view,

931
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.720
going back to what I've said before,
is how little amount of information

932
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.680
do I need to convince you
that I have a product to sell.

933
00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.640
So if I'm a seller, for instance,

934
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.600
so whether that be on a social media
marketplace, whether that be on Instagram

935
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.240
or social media
or it's an email or it's a website,

936
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:55.400
is that there's very little verification
that I have in my possession.

937
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.920
The product for me to sell to you.

938
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.520
Now, we've seen rises in holiday scams.

939
00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.560
We've seen a rise in things
like rental fraud in the last year,

940
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.840
especially with kind of high rental prices
and prices and competition.

941
00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.960
All of these sorts of things contribute
it and purchase scams kind of covers

942
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.920
a lot of these different multitudes
of of methods in order to do so.

943
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.800
So very often in these sorts of purchase
scams is again, it's taking that aspect.

944
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.120
So for instance, I can go on to a website
or I can go to a seller.

945
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.240
Well, actually,
if I go to a different website

946
00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:32.640
that's not necessarily regulated or is not
necessarily got like those security

947
00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.960
in those processes, it's
about making sure that you read reviews,

948
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.880
absolutely read reviews
around a potential brand,

949
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.760
a potential product
or a potential seller, for instance,

950
00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.400
in these given situations to, again,
get the measure of support

951
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.200
potentially, some people have been victim
victimized a bit before.

952
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.840
So I think all these given situations,
how do I trust that that product exists?

953
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.720
And unfortunately very often
in today's world, it's it's very difficult

954
00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:06.360
to do sometimes, but very often it's
also checking your emotion.

955
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.320
Very often we're excited
when we've seen those deals,

956
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.840
and very often when we talk about it,
it's too good to be true.

957
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.440
Well, actually, very often
we don't in an emotional state,

958
00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.280
we don't do
what is good in those situations.

959
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.000
So doing that, trusting and verifying,

960
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.160
taking those processes,
reading reviews, making sure that you try,

961
00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.240
try and make sure

962
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.240
that you kind of concentrate
on more of the beaten track

963
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.200
in relation to online websites
and and trusted websites as well.

964
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.480
Very often is the case

965
00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.000
because there's nothing,

966
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.120
no regulation stopping me
from creating any other website, etc.

967
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.680
and to try and sell you something that
doesn't even exist in the first place.

968
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.280
So that's what my advice is.

969
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.560
It's brilliant.

970
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.120
That's absolutely excellent.

971
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:50.240
Paul And then I think we definitely
have time for one more question,

972
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.960
and you will both have to forgive me
because I'm going to open this one up

973
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.400
the both here and I am kind of asking you
to predict the future a little bit here.

974
00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.280
And but as technology advances,

975
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:04.200
what do we predict
the next big scam is going to be?

976
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.120
Or what are we doing as organizations

977
00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:12.560
to raise awareness
about new types of fraud and scams?

978
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.840
Yeah, so one thing,

979
00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.480
at least from our perspective,

980
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.520
we've already kind of looked at
or we're already aware of,

981
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:23.720
and we've got sort of measures starting
to be developed and stuff like that is,

982
00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:28.440
as I'm sure everyone has probably heard
recently, is the impact of AI,

983
00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.760
deepfakes, voice, biometrics,
that type of stuff.

984
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.640
So it's very much it's becoming.

985
00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.360
So when we spoke at the very,
very beginning of the call

986
00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:43.080
about the digitization of fraud and scams
and stuff like that, that's developing,

987
00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:47.120
that's the reality of AI,
probably what's going to be happening next

988
00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:53.000
and and what's AI is potentially going
to bring to that aspect.

989
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.720
And like we said,
and unfortunately fraudsters and stuff

990
00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.440
like that, they're developing.

991
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.320
So at least from our perspective,
that's probably what's going to be

992
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.080
coming around the corner.

993
00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.280
But as I say, there is stuff
behind the scenes in our in our voice

994
00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:11.480
and in our stuff that's that's being
developed within our our cybercrime team.

995
00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:15.800
Basically.

996
00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.760
And I think

997
00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.920
on top of that is it's
like I've said, around the limited level

998
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.520
level of verification
that I need to convince you I am who I say I am

999
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:28.920
or a product or a holiday or anything
like that or an investment opportunity.

1000
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.320
Unfortunately, things like AI Deepfake
does kind of almost reduce

1001
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:38.160
that level of trust that we can have
in the content in which we can see.

1002
00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.200
So very often is the case
where we are vulnerable to fraud and scams

1003
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:46.920
in the same way that we are vulnerable
to disinformation, misinformation,

1004
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.840
online grooming, online dating, coercion,
everything comes down to it

1005
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.840
because have you ever taken a text message
the wrong way from a partner?

1006
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.040
Have you ever taken an email

1007
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.960
the wrong way from a colleague
or all these sorts of things

1008
00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.760
is because our emotional relationship
with our technology

1009
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:05.960
in these seamless, subjective forms,
very often it takes takes real presidents

1010
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:10.280
and importantly things
like with AI and Deepfake, it again

1011
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.800
reinforces things like the context
and authority and urgency,

1012
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.520
making it much more believable,
maybe making the language a lot more

1013
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.200
convincing in these sorts of situations.

1014
00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:24.760
But again, regardless of any of these
different changes in the future,

1015
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.440
it's going to be your emotion
that is triggered,

1016
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:28.680
it is going to be your emotions.

1017
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:32.120
And then unfortunately for me,
from a psychology

1018
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.200
point of view that's going to move
a lot slower than anything else.

1019
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:39.080
So asking you to have those moments,
regardless of what you're reading,

1020
00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:43.600
what you're seeing, what you're exposed
to, having that emotional moment to go,

1021
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:49.800
is this something I can trust, stop,
challenge and protect in those moments?

1022
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:50.720
Fantastic.

1023
00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:54.360
Thank you both so much for our time
for that insight and of course, for giving

1024
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.520
up your time to join the event today
and sharing your expertise with us all.

1025
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.840
And of course, thank you to our audience
who have joined us for the session today.

1026
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.360
And I know I speak for us all.

1027
00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:07.880
When I said we could have kept you here
all day talking about these topics.

1028
00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.080
And that is just because
there are so many different channels,

1029
00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.880
so many different tactics
that those cyber criminals do use.

1030
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:18.320
And as we've seen throughout the session,
there's lots of different ways

1031
00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.880
that they will target us.

1032
00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.360
But the best way of protecting ourselves
is to continue to expand

1033
00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.120
our knowledge on the tactics
that they use.

1034
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.800
And thankfully,
there are lots of brilliant resources

1035
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:33.080
available that can support those
on our learning journeys.

1036
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.640
The first of which
we're going to talk about

1037
00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.520
today
is the Take Five to Stop Fraud website,

1038
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.520
which Paul has mentioned
throughout the session today.

1039
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:44.160
So Take Five is an initiative
led by UK Finance

1040
00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:48.080
and backed by the UK Government
and other organizations, and it's designed

1041
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:53.000
to help you expand your knowledge
on how we will be targeted by criminals.

1042
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.720
So if you do receive a phone
call, text message or email

1043
00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.720
that you think may be fake,
it ordered you to stop,

1044
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:03.680
take five and challenge
what you are being told.

1045
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.000
As we've seen today, criminals are experts

1046
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.720
at impersonating people, organizations
and of course the police.

1047
00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:13.840
And they will spend hours
researching us for their scams.

1048
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.640
So they will be hoping
that we let our guard down

1049
00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:21.120
just for that brief moment, that that's
where they will see their biggest success.

1050
00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:26.480
So as Paul mentioned, stop and think
it could protect you and your money.

1051
00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:30.440
And remember, only criminals
will ever try and rush you or panic

1052
00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.920
you and to making those quick decisions.

1053
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.680
And we also have a lot of information
available through the fraud

1054
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:41.920
and Scams
section of our Barclays.co.uk website.

1055
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000
This contains lots of information
which includes tips to help us identify

1056
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.400
when we're being targeted
and how to keep ourselves safe online.

1057
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.200
This includes resources like phone
number, checkers and a jargon buster.

1058
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.560
To help you understand

1059
00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:59.960
different words and phrases
we use when talking about fraud and scams.

1060
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.600
But we also run regular online

1061
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.960
events to help people
learn about fraud and scams.

1062
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:06.600
And part of

1063
00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:11.600
this is also making our events available
through the Barclays.co.uk website.

1064
00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.360
Now, I did see we had a lot of questions
come through today

1065
00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.120
about these forwarder events.

1066
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:20.240
So through this platform you'll be able
to access our impersonation scams event

1067
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.600
where we had our guest speakers
to provide insight into the latest trends.

1068
00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:28.000
And we also have
our impersonation scams event

1069
00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.600
which can give you tips on
how to protect yourself when targeted by

1070
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.760
someone claiming to be a friend
or family member,

1071
00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:39.480
an organization that you have dealings
with, or of course, the police.

1072
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.120
Now, another

1073
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.160
point on the Money Mules event
that we ran back in September.

1074
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.560
If you've ever wondered how criminals move
stolen money around, money, mules,

1075
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:50.560
as we heard today, is one of the ways
in which they do that.

1076
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.480
And this often involves them
approaching young people

1077
00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.040
on social media platforms
to help them do this.

1078
00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.320
So through that event will explain
what money

1079
00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.320
mules actually are
and how to spot those warning signs.

1080
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:09.080
All of this and much more is accessible
through our Barclays.co.uk web platform.

1081
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.360
And then finally,
we have our free interactive learning

1082
00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.600
platform, Digital Wings.

1083
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:18.280
This platform is designed to help you
boost your digital skills and confidence

1084
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:23.640
around a variety of different topics,
including staying safe online

1085
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.840
through our Online Safety Hub
we have lots of information,

1086
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:31.280
including bite sized learning modules,
internal resources and links

1087
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.560
to external organizations
who can support us

1088
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.640
all in expanding our knowledge
on this important topic,

1089
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.520
which is going to be applicable
to each and every one of us.

1090
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:44.080
Because of course, what we've learned
today is scammers do not discriminate.

1091
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.720
They will target any of us at any time.

1092
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.600
And we also

1093
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:52.360
have a lot of information through that
safety board on how to report suspicious

1094
00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:56.600
emails, text messages and phone calls
through the relevant channels.

1095
00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.960
But we also have a link in that safety
call to the National Cyber

1096
00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.720
Security Center Cyber Aware Action Plan.

1097
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.560
If you've not heard of this resource,
it supports individuals and organizations.

1098
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.040
By having them answer
a couple of questions on topics

1099
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:14.280
like passwords and two step verification,
after which they'll be provided

1100
01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:19.200
with a free, personalized list of actions
to help improve their cybersecurity,

1101
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.120
which, as we saw, aligns
a lot to point fake

1102
01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.320
emails or suspicious links
about malicious software.

1103
01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.760
We talked about today.

1104
01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.920
So just to close off the session,
it's important

1105
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.920
to remember that
anyone can be tricked by a scammer.

1106
01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.720
They will change their tactics
often and adapt quickly to changes

1107
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.720
in the economic climate.

1108
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.040
And we're constantly uncovering new scams.

1109
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.520
And the best way for us to continue
to protect ourselves

1110
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.520
and the people around us
is by expanding our knowledge

1111
01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.880
on these subjects
and sharing that within our networks

1112
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.080
so that everyone
we do hope you've enjoyed the event today.

1113
01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.960
We will be sending out a short feedback
survey off the back of the event

1114
01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.960
today where you can share
your thoughts on the events.

1115
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.720
You know, we did have so many questions
come through today.

1116
01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.240
Unfortunately,
we didn't get to answer them all.

1117
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.640
But we will be looking at planning our
next upskill event in order to of 2024.

1118
01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.160
And we will use all of the insight

1119
01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.000
you've raised in the meeting today
to shape those topics.

1120
01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.240
But if you do have anything in particular
you'd like to see for the future,

1121
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.640
please do let us know through that
feedback survey.

1122
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.480
Any thoughts that you think we could
implement to make these events better?

1123
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.240
We will take each of those comments

1124
01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.720
and use them to shape our future
digital safety events.

1125
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.920
Also, if you really enjoyed the event,
the topics were relevant, it's

1126
01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.920
giving you a lot of insight that you can
now share within your network.

1127
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.120
Those nine and tens are just as important
because they reassure us all

1128
01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.640
that we're doing the right things for you
and our future.

1129
01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.240
Attendees.

1130
01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.240
But with that, everyone
have a wonderful day and we look forward

1131
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.400
to seeing you on another
one of our upskill events very, very soon.
