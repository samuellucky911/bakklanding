1
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.400
Good afternoon everyone and a very warm
welcome to this Barclays event.

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.280
Money mules.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.600
What are they? And how to avoid the trap.

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.800
So firstly, some introductions before
we hand over to our guest speakers.

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.000
Firstly, I’m Ross Martin,
Head of Digital Safety at Barclays

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.320
and I work in our Barclays
Digital Eagles Team.

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.920
I'm delighted to say I'm joined
by some excellent guest speakers,

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.880
Sam Brooker from our Barclays Mules Team.

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.560
And I'm also delighted to say
we're joined by Ebony King,

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.520
Youth Advocate and Founder of
Elevate Her UK charity.

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.040
Earning extra money

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.040
for doing very little
may sound attractive.

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.800
The promise on offer of easy money

14
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.040
with no strings attached

15
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.960
would lure many people in.

16
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.800
But what's the catch?

17
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.720
Today you'll be hearing from Sam,
who'll be providing an insight

18
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.160
into what the banking industry are doing
to monitor and detect suspicious mule activity

19
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.880
and what Barclays are doing to help
protect and educate our customers.

20
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.960
You'll also be hearing from Ebony,
who will be sharing her own story,

21
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.360
how she was targeted and the consequences
she has experienced as a result.

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.360
Towards the end of today's event,
there will be a Q&A session.

23
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.800
So throughout the event, we would really
like you to submit your questions

24
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.320
using the functionality you see on-screen.

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.480
And we'll do our best to pose as many of
these questions to Sam and Ebony.

26
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.320
So in the top right corner of your screen,

27
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.360
you'll see the option to
type your question

28
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.400
and then simply click ‘Submit’
for us to receive your question.

29
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.320
So now I'd like to introduce
our first guest speaker

30
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.400
Sam Brooker, from the Barclays Mules Team.

31
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.760
Over to you, Sam.

32
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.600
Thank you, Ross, and
welcome everyone,

33
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.160
and thank you for joining us today to talk
about this very compelling subject.

34
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.480
Money mules, so what are they?

35
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.520
I'm here to talk to you about how criminals

36
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.960
use money mules to move money.

37
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.880
So let's start at the beginning and try
to explain what a money mule actually is.

38
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.640
A money mule is someone who lets criminals
use their bank accounts to move money.

39
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.960
Often that mule doesn't know
what's really happening

40
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.280
and has been manipulated
into believing a cover story

41
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.120
or lured by an offer of a repayment.

42
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.880
There are two main types of money mules.

43
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.480
One of those will be witting.

44
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.280
Witting mules are generally complicit with the crime.

45
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.200
They are aware
of the criminal source of funds

46
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.200
and typically they can be recruited
using social media platforms.

47
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.640
Most commonly Instagram, WhatsApp
or Snapchat.

48
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.800
Account holders are generally lured
by quick cash opportunities

49
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.120
and will disclose their
account security details,

50
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.680
payment cards and PINs
in exchange for monetary rewards.

51
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.000
They may also receive
and send on criminal funds themselves,

52
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.440
but generally they're aware
that what they're doing is actually wrong.

53
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.520
Then on the flip side, there’s the unwitting.

54
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.200
These individuals engage in mule
activity generally under false pretences.

55
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.760
It could involve exploitation, where they're
duped into distributing payments,

56
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.440
while actually being scammed themselves.

57
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.400
You might also have heard
the term ‘mule herder’.

58
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.760
So what is a mule herder?

59
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.920
Well, they are the key support
to the criminal gangs as it's them

60
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.560
who recruit the actual money
mule to do the job for them.

61
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.840
They do that by searching
your social media profile for information

62
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.680
and then use it to befriend you, or trick
you into receiving stolen money

63
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.720
into your bank account.

64
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.960
That's the key thing that a mule herder
is looking for - you to have a bank account.

65
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.840
They might approach you online
through a messaging app

66
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.680
or actually in person at the school gates
or in the workplace or at university.

67
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.440
They are importantly the link
between the mule

68
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.840
and the organised crime gangs,

69
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.360
or OCG’s as we call them,
along with law enforcement.

70
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.040
These OCG's could be funding
terrorism across the world

71
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.760
like drugs or human
trafficking - sexual exploitation.

72
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.520
And it scares me to think of the innocent
people encountering these dangerous individuals.

73
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.320
So what does money mule activity
actually look like?

74
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.360
Mule herders
tend to lie to get what they want.

75
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.440
They might say it's quick and easy
and, you know,

76
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.760
no ramifications involved in doing it.

77
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.640
And it's an easy way to make money, or that
they urgently need to receive a payment.

78
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.200
And you're the only one who can help them.

79
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.440
But they can't use their own account
for whatever reason.

80
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.200
They might even offer a cash or
gifts as a reward or incentive.

81
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.200
The herder will use that cover story
as an excuse to pass you that stolen money.

82
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.960
They might ask you to open
a bank account yourself,

83
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.400
if you don't already have one.

84
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.000
They might transfer money to you
or give you cash to pay into your account.

85
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.640
They could ask you to
pass it on by a bank transfer,

86
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.640
or withdraw it as cash,
or even ask you to buy,

87
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.400
to purchase a high value item
in exchange for the money.

88
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.600
Importantly, passed back
to the criminal network.

89
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.480
They might ask for your
online banking details

90
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.880
so that they can do the activities
themselves on your own account.

91
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.160
Or they might ask for an activation code
to access your banking app.

92
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.640
But importantly, it lets them
access your account

93
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.480
and use it to clean their dirty money.

94
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.600
Which means to essentially confuse
the origin of the funds

95
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.560
and to make those funds appear genuine.

96
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.720
They also could actually buy
an item from you

97
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.960
and ask to pay by bank transfer.

98
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.440
But the important thing is they tend
to pay from a stolen account

99
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.200
and you give them the item and often
you can lose those funds

100
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.240
once the criminal nature of them
is understood

101
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.680
by the banking system.

102
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.560
So is it a crime to act as a money mule?

103
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.040
Well, absolutely. Yes, it is.

104
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.560
Unfortunately, handling money
that comes from illegal activity is a crime,

105
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.800
even if you don't know what you're doing.

106
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.040
Money can often be traced

107
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.920
to someone who has been the
victim of a scam or a fraud.

108
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.720
I'm sure we all know someone
who has been affected by a scam

109
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.520
at some point in the past.

110
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.480
Whether they're old or
young, vulnerable or not,

111
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.840
UK Finance, who are the trade
association for the banking industry,

112
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.920
have advised that over £1.2 billion

113
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.120
was stolen through fraud last year.

114
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.680
That's the equivalent of
over £2,300 every minute.

115
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.880
Most importantly, if we didn't have mules,

116
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.480
there would not be a route to take
a lot of those funds from those victims.

117
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.200
They simply wouldn't be able to operate.

118
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.960
If you are a mule, the
consequences can range from

119
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.040
your bank account being closed,
to even going to prison.

120
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.720
But what is the reality of getting caught

121
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.280
and what impact could this have
on your lifestyle or your future?

122
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.080
For most people, getting caught means
that your bank account could be closed

123
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.200
and you'll have problems opening a new one.

124
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.480
That makes paying your basic
living expenses so much harder,

125
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.560
removes any independence that you might have.

126
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.080
You could find it difficult to get credit

127
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.080
like a student loan, phone contract,
or a mortgage or a loan.

128
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.160
You could end up with a criminal record

129
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.640
and that could affect your ability
to get a job or to go to university.

130
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.000
But you could also go to prison
for up to 14 years.

131
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.240
So it's important that
you know the warning signs -

132
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.920
the red flags to look out for.

133
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.400
This can help you identify mule herders
and avoid falling for their tricks.

134
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.760
Or contact from someone that you don't know

135
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.800
trying to befriend you,

136
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.640
especially online or through
a messaging app.

137
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.000
Look out for someone you may also, who may
also ask you to move money for them.

138
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.680
Always check that you know
where the funds have come from.

139
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.720
Look out for anyone
you've met online, 

140
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.240
offering deals that sound
too good to be true.

141
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.800
It often is.

142
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.080
Be suspicious of jobs offering
quick and easy money

143
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.480
with no experience necessary.

144
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.160
Be wary of anyone who
asks to transfer money

145
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.040
to your bank account for you
to pass on to another account.

146
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.840
And take care when selling an item,

147
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.280
where the buyer insists on
paying by bank transfer

148
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.760
or pressuring you for a quick sale.

149
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.960
Or even paying over the odds,
that's not usual.

150
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.880
So what are Barclays
doing to target mules?

151
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.120
We focus on prevention.

152
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.080
If we can prevent a mule,

153
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.400
we can prevent a potential scam,
and that means less victims.

154
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.680
We do this by providing targeted education

155
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.040
to our colleagues and customers
on how to protect themselves.

156
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.880
Our priority is to protect our customers
as well as society in general

157
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.000
of the dangers presented by criminal gangs
who are at the heart of this problem.

158
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.120
Last year, 43% of mule cases
identified by Barclays

159
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.200
were individuals under the age of 25.

160
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.560
So we tend to do lots of targeted messages

161
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.120
in those younger age categories.

162
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.520
The children's digital banking
market is expanding.

163
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.040
UK finance revealed that the number
of 14 to 18-year-olds

164
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.960
misusing their bank account
rose by 73% in the last two years.

165
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.120
There are even reports of children
as young as 12

166
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.080
being persuaded to comply
with the misuse of their accounts.

167
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.640
If we can't prevent
someone being recruited,

168
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.120
we do also monitor payments
and react in the moment

169
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.080
as time is of the essence to trap criminal
funds before the mule can move them.

170
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.760
We also work with many suppliers

171
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.720
who provide a range of
ways to detect money mules.

172
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.360
But more than ever,
we're sharing more information

173
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.960
across the banking industry
to jointly tackle the problem.

174
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.120
There is more government
regulation coming to banks,

175
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.240
which compels the whole industry to
collaborate and work together.

176
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.160
Over the first six months of 2023,

177
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:50.440
17,286 cases involving money
mule activities were filed.

178
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.920
And that includes 3,881
people under the age of 21.

179
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.920
A growing number of
other age groups 

180
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.240
are also being recruited
by criminal gangs too.

181
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.320
Between 2017 and 2021

182
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.680
we've seen a 34% increase
in the number of accounts

183
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.160
belonging to 40 to 60-year-olds
displaying money mule activity.

184
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.160
That's really unusual.

185
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.720
But obviously, in trying to target all areas 

186
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.880
and all age groups in
which mule operates,

187
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.920
we know that genuine customers

188
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.800
can sometimes be impacted
as we try to look for suspicion.

189
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.120
So it may be that we have to
delay payment sometimes

190
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.160
just to check that we feel that
the origins of that payment are genuine.

191
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.520
But a key priority for us is always

192
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.520
to limit the impact on genuine customers.

193
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.080
We want Barclays to make money work
for the genuine people,

194
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.160
not the criminals.

195
00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.400
And with that  I'll hand
back to you, Ross.

196
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.400
Thank you.

197
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.680
Thanks very much, Sam.

198
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.880
Really insightful.

199
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.360
Lots for us to think about,
but really good to understand

200
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.760
the size of the problem and
what we're doing to really address it.

201
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.920
Thank you very much.

202
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.160
So, we're going to move on
to our next guest speaker.

203
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.440
Ebony, thank you for supporting this event
today, it’s much appreciated.

204
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.240
And I'm sure the insight
and thoughts you're going to share

205
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.600
will add so much value for everybody
who's attending the event.

206
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.760
I'd like to ask you, first of all,
if we were to rewind

207
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.240
12 years ago, can you share
what happened to you?

208
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.880
What was your experience?

209
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.920
Thank you, Ross.

210
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.840
Good afternoon everyone.

211
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.920
What happened to me was that

212
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.920
I actually trusted a friend,

213
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.360
someone that was very close to me

214
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.600
who was like a brother.

215
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.320
We were so close.

216
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.920
He was like an older brother to me.

217
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.720
And I had borrowed him some money.

218
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.560
It was something as little as,
I think, £50 or something.

219
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.920
I had just finished sixth form college.

220
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:06.560
I was going into uni and
I borrowed him £50.

221
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.840
He said he needed it desperately
and in the past I've helped him.

222
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.720
He's helped me.

223
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.280
We had like a good relationship.

224
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.080
So I had no reason to think
anything of it.

225
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.600
So I borrowed him the £50

226
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.600
and then I kept asking him, you know,
when will you pay me back?

227
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.680
It  took a while for
him to pay me back.

228
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.520
And then one day, when he
was ready to pay me back,

229
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:35.200
he called me and told me that he has
paid me back into my bank account

230
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.640
because he had asked me for my bank
account a few weeks before that.

231
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.240
And then I, you know, I went to
the bank, not on the same day.

232
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.840
I can't remember
exactly the timescale,

233
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.120
but I eventually went to the bank to go
withdraw some change out

234
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.920
so that I can buy some
things for my son and I, 

235
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.160
because I had just become a
teenage mum as well at that time.

236
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:05.440
And it's important to note that
this account was a savings account,

237
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.080
it was a passbook account.

238
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.800
Therefore, I had no access to online banking.

239
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.360
I had no access to mobile
banking at the time.

240
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.800
So when he did say that he
had paid the money in,

241
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.720
I couldn't check using my phone.

242
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.520
I couldn't check using laptop or internet.

243
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.680
I didn't have any internet
access for this.

244
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.320
So I had to go into the bank
with the passbook

245
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.840
and go to the cashier and
ask to withdraw some money.

246
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.200
So all this time, I'm just thinking
like 'it's legitimate money'

247
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.040
I didn't know it has you know, where,

248
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.040
I didn't know the source of where
the money would come from.

249
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.520
I just thought it was from him.

250
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.680
It wasn't until about I think
six to nine months later,

251
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.400
I was at my mum's house,

252
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.560
and very early in the morning,
I got the loud bang at the door

253
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.720
and it was the police
knocking on the door.

254
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.560
And so they basically they came
to raid my mum's house.

255
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.000
And I was just in shock

256
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.080
because I was literally the teenager.

257
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.960
I had just had a child.

258
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.120
And I was just thinking, what's going on?

259
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.600
So they took me -

260
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.800
so when I got to the station
and I found out what it was about,

261
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.480
like what it was for, for fraud.

262
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.880
And I was still shocked because
I didn't know what was going on.

263
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.600
And then when I had to go to court,
that is when I found out

264
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.320
that the money that my so-called friend

265
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.240
had put into my account, had belonged
to someone else who they had scammed.

266
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:41.680
So I was used as, my account was used, 
and I was used as a mule without even knowing,

267
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.080
you know, without having any knowledge.

268
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.800
I was vulnerable and naïve.

269
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.600
I didn't know.

270
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.760
And then after that, I was very lucky

271
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.680
because the judge just,

272
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.040
they just gave me,

273
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.840
 they gave me community service and a fine.

274
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.400
This was, I was very lucky to not go to prison

275
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.920
because I had just become a mum
and I had no previous criminal record.

276
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.720
I had good character, you know, I was just,

277
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.040
a student going, getting ready
to go to uni with a young son,

278
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.400
like I was not,
I am not into the life of crime.

279
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.840
Yes, I was, you know, around,

280
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.200
I had friends, I lived on my own.

281
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.160
But I didn't, you know,
everything was just new to me.

282
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.440
So, I was lucky to not go to prison.

283
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.640
However, my DBS,
which is formerly known as a CRB,

284
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.640
was stained for over 12 years.

285
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.800
It had only become clear
the beginning of this year,

286
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.080
which is why I'm coming out
to tell my story now.

287
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.160
And yeah, so,

288
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.320
it was not a good experience for me.

289
00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.760
I was lucky because I actually was able
to still get a job, to get jobs.

290
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.280
I had a job within the NHS
with a local authority before,

291
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.440
but that's because when I
explained my story to each manager,

292
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.320
they could understand

293
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.280
and they could sympathise with me
and see that it wasn't even my fault.

294
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.200
But there are some other young
people out there who they don't have,

295
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.440
they don't have these opportunities
and they don't get these chances.

296
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.000
So yeah, it's a very unfortunate
thing that happened.

297
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.440
Ross, over to you.

298
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.240
Ebony thank you so much
for sharing all of that detail,

299
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.400
your experience. 

300
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.640
I can tell, just listening to your story,

301
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.880
you went through an awful lot, especially
for someone of such a young age.

302
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.920
That's a lot to deal with
and obviously a lot to, to take in.

303
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.840
I’ve got a couple of follow-up
questions for you specifically,

304
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.040
if that's okay.

305
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:53.080
Firstly, were you aware of any other
young people in your circle of friends

306
00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.160
that were perhaps allowing
their bank account to be used?

307
00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.080
Being, were they approached at all?

308
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.720
Was that something you
saw sort of at the time?

309
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.200
To be honest, it wasn't,

310
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.320
it wasn't as,

311
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:14.040
I think it was going on,
but it wasn't as rampant as it is today.

312
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.160
So, you know, there was no
cause for concern for me

313
00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.640
because I didn't think
it would happen to me,

314
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.360
because it wasn't obvious
like how it is today, basically.

315
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.160
So I think there were few people
that had been used as mules,

316
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.520
but it wasn't anything significant
for me to be worried about

317
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.600
or to be, to know about basically.

318
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.320
Yeah, sure.

319
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.200
And I guess in your particular
experience, in your scenario,

320
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.480
you were effectively lending
somebody some money

321
00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.880
and that was sort of how simple the,

322
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.080
you know, the sort of agreement,
the transaction was.

323
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.120
I guess, a question,
a good question to ask, if we can is,

324
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.040
would the benefit of hindsight
and just looking back,

325
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.080
was there any one thing that you would say

326
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.000
was a red flag for you at that time,

327
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.960
in terms of the conversation that was being had 

328
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.520
what was being asked of you
any, specific red flag?

329
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.640
To be honest,
there were no red flags at the time.

330
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.680
However, looking back on it
now, a red flag would be

331
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.040
the fact that the money that my
so-called friend had repaid me with

332
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.920
was more than the amount
that I had borrowed him.

333
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.200
If that happened today,
that is going to be a red flag,

334
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.200
because why would you be paying that
three times more than what I paid you?

335
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.960
And also another red flag,

336
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.640
I mean, if back then, you know, the whole,

337
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.240
it wasn't, the whole online banking
and mobile banking wasn't,

338
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.200
we didn't really use it
that much back then, so.

339
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.920
But if it was now

340
00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.160
and if I had mobile banking,

341
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.880
I will be able to check my
account to see what,

342
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.000
you know, to see the name on the account
of where the money came from.

343
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.880
And then that would have made
me think I'll contact him

344
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.640
be like, you know,
this is not in your name.

345
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.000
Whose name is this? Whose account is this?

346
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.440
And then I probably would,
then I would have called the bank as well

347
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.720
and found out, and where's
this money coming from?

348
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.800
So yeah, those, that would
probably be the red flag.

349
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.920
Yeah, thanks Ebony.

350
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.440
And would you agree, with technology now,

351
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.200
we can manage our bank account
obviously via our smartphone,

352
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.200
we can do that online,

353
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.920
we can do that 24/7.

354
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.320
That makes it really easy
for us to stay on top of

355
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.440
you know, the things that go
in our account, the things that come out.

356
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.960
But I guess the other side
of the advancements in technology

357
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.040
means that actually young people, it's
so much easier for them to be targeted.

358
00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.800
Would you say that's the case?

359
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.400
Definitely.

360
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.040
The access to social media
that young people have,

361
00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.600
whether it's TikTok, these apps, a lot of
these criminals target them through that.

362
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.680
So, yeah, it’s very bad to be honest.

363
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.600
Thanks Ebony.

364
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.280
So I guess from your point of view,

365
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.600
there's lots that you would
really like to do to help others - 

366
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.960
young people who may be
vulnerable, may be at risk.

367
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.280
What from your point of view,
what can teachers, parents,

368
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.480
guardians, carers, all of those people,
what could they do to help prevent

369
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.360
these young people falling victim?

370
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.080
Parents, educators, teachers,

371
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.600
the community, to be honest, should
do more of talking to the young people,

372
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.960
raising awareness, educating them.

373
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.160
Showing, even if you can just show them
a video online,

374
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.920
show them videos, awareness videos,

375
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:58.560
you know, constantly remind them
to be checking their accounts regularly

376
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.280
and to be very cautious,
you know, just constant education,

377
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.320
they need financial education.

378
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.160
Yeah, awareness, I'll say.

379
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.000
Yeah, absolutely.

380
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.960
I guess it's making sure
young people feel comfortable with

381
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.960
actually having that open conversation
with a parent, teacher,

382
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.520
especially if they feel
they're involved in a conversation

383
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.520
that just doesn't seem
right, feels uncomfortable.

384
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.560
I think that's key.

385
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.440
Just before we move into the other questions
we've received during the event,

386
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.920
so I mentioned the beginning of your charity.

387
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.760
So Elevate Her UK, I know
coming up later this year,

388
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.640
you've got a campaign launching
on protecting young people

389
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.240
from financial exploitation.

390
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.000
Could you just share briefly
why you're launching that campaign,

391
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.520
what are you looking to achieve?

392
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:56.880
Okay.

393
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.240
Yes, that campaign is actually called
‘Don't Get Finessed’.

394
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.600
For those that don't know what finessed means,

395
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.000
don't get scammed basically.

396
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.600
We want to raise awareness, like I said,
raise awareness on these issues

397
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.280
because not every young person
is aware of the consequences.

398
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.600
Not every young person is aware
of how to avoid these situations.

399
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.520
So that campaign will be raising
awareness.

400
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.000
It will be educating not just young people,

401
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.760
it will be educating everyone
in the community, teachers, parents.

402
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.040
The campaign is also there to

403
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:36.360
we're trying to see if we can
get some policy changes as well

404
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.360
because some of the young people,
they are vulnerable and they are,

405
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.400
they don't even know,

406
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.280
like in my case,
I didn't know what was going on.

407
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.760
And I don't think it's fair

408
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.640
that I got punished for something
that I didn't do or I wasn't aware of.

409
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.320
I think they need to stop punishing the,

410
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.520
like they need to actually
do proper investigations

411
00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.200
and find out the people at the
top of the chain and punish them.

412
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.360
And I think there should be more
safeguarding measures

413
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.720
for young people or vulnerable people,

414
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.480
more early intervention,

415
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.000
especially in the hotspot areas in London.

416
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.840
Not a lot of them
have this financial education in schools,

417
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.080
so it's good that our campaign
video will be used in the schools

418
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.080
that we go to, which are in London.

419
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.240
We’ll be playing these videos in school,

420
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.040
in the workshops
that we go to, to educate them.

421
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.560
Yeah, and that's it really - the campaign’s
just to raise awareness

422
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.320
and to see how we can find solutions.

423
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.840
Yeah, that's amazing Ebony.

424
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.280
I would definitely recommend
everybody have a look

425
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.640
at their websites, so Elevate Her UK.

426
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.320
You'll find that online.

427
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.240
Amazing work that you do
there and much needed 

428
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.600
and I think just an example of how

429
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.040
we need to come together across
the industry, across all organisations

430
00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.200
to make sure that we can
reach those people 

431
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.920
who need the education,
they need that support.

432
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.760
So thanks again, Ebony
for sharing your experience, your story

433
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.480
your recommendations in terms
of making sure we protect young people

434
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.720
before they even, you know, start
being involved in these conversations,

435
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.080
these interactions.

436
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.840
So we'll now move on to some of
the other questions that we've had.

437
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.080
So thank you for the questions
you have submitted,

438
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.240
I'm going to pose these questions
to both yourself, Sam and Ebony, 

439
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.240
depending on the question

440
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.080
and I guess what's relevant
from your sort of positions.

441
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:41.840
So, let me start with one of
the questions we've had.

442
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.360
So one for you Sam.

443
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.320
In Ebony's case and we can't talk
specifically about the case,

444
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.840
but in cases similar to this, would
the bank not ask questions

445
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.680
as to the money coming in, going out of the account,

446
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.960
which is not in line with normal activity?

447
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.960
What's your view on that?

448
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.520
Yeah, it's a really good point.

449
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:13.000
One of the concerns from hearing
Ebony's story myself was that, 

450
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.600
you know, she's the one who's had all the impact

451
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.840
and the criminals got away scot-free,
who's done the actual act.

452
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.080
And that is often the case with our money
mules unfortunately, you know,

453
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.240
you're the front person then,
the only person who can be traced

454
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.680
and the criminals stand behind that,
unfortunately.

455
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:38.080
What I would say is the more
information that mules can tell us

456
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.640
about how they got recruited,

457
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.760
who was involved, any
details they can tell us

458
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:51.000
all adds to our ability to take action
potentially against the real people,

459
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.360
the real perpetrators of the crime.

460
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.520
And we can feed that information
to law enforcement,

461
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:04.040
you know, and hope that there
could be some broader action taken.

462
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.360
But again, the more information
that mules can give to us,

463
00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.760
we can take that into consideration.

464
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.920
You know, if there's any
vulnerability, exploitation

465
00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.360
of that particular individual,
we want to know about it.

466
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.720
And we want to give our mules,
the opportunity to tell us,

467
00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.800
you know, if there's
any other circumstances involved,

468
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.800
that's really, really important
because, you know, unfortunately,

469
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.880
some of our young people are very,
very vulnerable, as Ebony has pointed out.

470
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.080
And, you know, it's not fair
that they should feel

471
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.080
the brunt of a criminals act, essentially.

472
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.160
So, yeah, that would be my advice.

473
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.640
Tell, tell as much as possible.

474
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.360
Thank you Sam.

475
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.880
I guess a follow-up question
to that one is,

476
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.120
if Barclays were to uncover a money mule,
what is our standpoint?

477
00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.880
Do we close their accounts
with notice to close?

478
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.720
Would we ban customers
from re-joining in the future?

479
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.720
What's the standpoint there?

480
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.400
Yeah, so typically

481
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.520
what would happen is that when we receive

482
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.640
a report that an account has received
the proceeds of crime,

483
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.040
we have to firstly secure
that bank account.

484
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.200
We have got a duty to obviously
try to prevent those criminal funds

485
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.400
from being dispersed and we have a duty

486
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.400
the victim of that crime.

487
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.280
Then we would investigate
our account holder.

488
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.520
That often involves contact
with the account holder,

489
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.760
again, to give them the opportunity
of telling us what's going on.

490
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.120
There could be
another side to the story.

491
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.600
But the typical action that we would take

492
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.600
would be that depending on what story
we do get from our account holder,

493
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:55.840
it would tend to result in the forced
closure of their bank account.

494
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.920
Sometimes immediately,

495
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:04.080
if we find that the risk presented
by the account holder is too great,

496
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.800
that we need to get them off our books
really, really quickly.

497
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.080
But often we do give them notice or

498
00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.880
we do give them another opportunity
to sort of prove that

499
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.080
they can turn, especially
if they're open and honest with us, turn,

500
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.880
you know, their banking
around and, you know,

501
00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.440
and use their banking accounts
exactly how they should do.

502
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.000
If we do exit a customer,

503
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.080
we do mark fraud databases.

504
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.840
We're also compelled to do that
amongst our industry partners

505
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.120
to ensure that we're sharing
information between ourselves

506
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.480
and that everybody in the
banking industry can see

507
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.560
what potential risk
a mule presents to them

508
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.280
if they're opening, if they're deciding
to open another bank account elsewhere.

509
00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:57.720
And that's why some customers will find it
difficult to get a bank account elsewhere,

510
00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.640
because obviously reference to
those industry databases

511
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.800
are referred to within the application
process for a new product.

512
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.880
Thanks again Sam.

513
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.640
Ebony, just coming over to you,

514
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.800
so did you admit to being a mule,
to the police unknowingly

515
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.160
or were you coerced
into accepting a caution?

516
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:29.160
Is there any way you could have
appealed the action that was taken

517
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.320
based on someone taking advantage of you?

518
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.600
Just wonder what your thoughts are on that one.

519
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.640
The thing is, I actually said not guilty
all the way.

520
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.640
And I actually did, in the interview,

521
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.120
I told them everything.

522
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.120
I told them the truth
and I told them that it wasn't me,

523
00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.080
but still that it was what, I mean,

524
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.160
I have spoken to officers
like years down the line recently

525
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.160
due to the charity work that I do with other
young people that go through this.

526
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.240
And I asked them, officer, like,
you know, why?

527
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.160
Why does that happen?

528
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:56.680
Why did they do it?

529
00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.280
And they said, unfortunately,
because investigations take too long

530
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:05.480
and are too costly, they usually use
the account holder as the scapegoat.

531
00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.800
So basically I was used as the scapegoat.

532
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.560
Yeah, sure.

533
00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.600
Thanks again for sharing Ebony.

534
00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.680
Just a quick question,
follow-up as well Ebony is,

535
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.520
in your situation,

536
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.880
you're the person who you
were talking with borrowed £50.

537
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.120
How much did they actually put
back into your account?

538
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.320
I think it was like £250.

539
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:35.960
Of course, that now might look
like a little bit, because I know now

540
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.240
a lot of these scammers
are they put four figures or more,

541
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.840
but then it was still,

542
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.160
it was still something and it's still,
you know,

543
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.440
the way it was, the source
of the money was not right.

544
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.680
So yes, I bought them 50
and I think they put they would

545
00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.040
put 200 or 250 back in. I'm not sure.

546
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.440
The thing is, I don't even actually
know the exact because

547
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.080
when I went to the bank, I just went do
what I needed to do for the shopping

548
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.080
and I never ever got to clear anything.

549
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.360
The bank just closed the account
and I couldn't even take the money out.

550
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.880
So yeah, it was at the, in the court,

551
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.520
at the court hearing that I heard,

552
00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.840
you know, what had happened

553
00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.840
and this is how much,
I think it was like 250, yeah.

554
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.400
Sure, thanks Ebony.

555
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.920
And what we do know worth sharing
is that in some cases

556
00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.520
people are given incentive
to keep obviously some of the money,

557
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:37.120
or it could be that they're
offered a particular item,

558
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.640
whether it be the latest pair of trainers
or something of value.

559
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.120
So we do see different
examples of where people

560
00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.200
perhaps are given motivation

561
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.240
in order to help somebody
to move this money around.

562
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.680
A question for you, Sam, if I can,

563
00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:01.760
are we looking at biometric patterns,
new tech to see if different people,

564
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.920
mules, are accessing the same accounts?

565
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.400
That's a really interesting question.

566
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.440
We, one of the stakeholders that we're,

567
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.480
suppliers that we're working with at present,

568
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.280
is one that offers biometric capability.

569
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.920
So it is an opportunity
for us in the future

570
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.080
and probably a lot of the industry
as well.

571
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.400
So, yes, it's definitely something
that is becoming

572
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.760
increasingly more
and more interesting to us.

573
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.920
We can't say that say any
more than that right now.

574
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.480
That's great. Thanks, Sam.

575
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.920
Another question for you, Sam is

576
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.400
do you get business accounts
being used for mules

577
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.080
as these have different limits

578
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.240
and are they perhaps harder
to detect the patterns?

579
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.960
Yeah, absolutely right.

580
00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.480
We do.

581
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.080
We do.

582
00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.760
And you've hit the nail on the head.

583
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.320
The reason being higher transfer
limits generally, you know

584
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.720
if you have a business account
that is expected to operate, you know,

585
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.720
with a lot of transactions
going through it,

586
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.520
then I guess the feeling is

587
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.760
that that will go under
the radar a little bit more,

588
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.440
you know, from a monitoring point of view.

589
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:20.320
But I can to tell you that we do catch
an awful lot of business banking money mules,

590
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:24.680
as well as personal money
mules in Barclays.

591
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.720
So yeah, we try to manage our defences

592
00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.760
across those segments quite equally,

593
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.240
depending on the risk that they present us,

594
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.520
because in one side of the business, 

595
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.160
they will present us more
in the way of volume

596
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.240
and the other side
will present more in the way of value.

597
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:49.040
So we do manage the risk
effectively across the two segments.

598
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.280
Thanks Sam.

599
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.000
Just another question for you as well.

600
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.720
Would you say due to the cost of living

601
00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.800
that we need to be even
more conscious and aware

602
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.360
of offers, of easy money

603
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.200
and the use of our bank
account, pay more attention

604
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.040
as both of you have already mentioned,
to what goes in and out of your account,

605
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.280
yeah, due to that cost of
living that we're seeing?

606
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.160
Absolutely.

607
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.680
From my point of view,
I think I mentioned earlier

608
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.320
that we've seen a 34% increase
in the number of accounts

609
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.120
being used by 40 to 60-year-olds.

610
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:31.240
That's a really unusual age group
to be involved in money muling.

611
00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.400
If I can be honest, normally it
would be it would be our,

612
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.520
very much younger age groups
that would become involved.

613
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:45.840
So that to me could indicate that
people are feeling the pinch a little,

614
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.360
you know, potentially

615
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.400
looking at this as an opportunity
to make a little bit more money.

616
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:56.560
So, yes, it's absolutely a risk
for those age groups.

617
00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.640
And, you know, for anybody

618
00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.920
who is feeling the pinch,
my advice would be

619
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.520
easy money is not always
the best way of making money.

620
00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:06.880
Yeah.

621
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.320
Thanks again, Sam.

622
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.040
So a question I'm actually
going to answer here is,

623
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.800
how do the so-called scammers
get one's landline number?

624
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.160
We get numerous calls
that are obviously a scam.

625
00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.120
So we're talking about
the general theme of scams here.

626
00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:24.120
And I think to answer this question,
is good just to raise awareness

627
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.560
that in terms of any of your
data or personal information,

628
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.880
including telephone numbers,
this can be accessed in various ways.

629
00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:34.120
One of the ways could be
the number of data breaches we see.

630
00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:39.280
So if an organisation's details are hacked,

631
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.000
if they can get access
to that information,

632
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.200
that could very easily be shared
or sold on what we call The Dark Web

633
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.200
so organised criminal gangs may be using
that information and passing it on.

634
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.320
But also the other piece of awareness
we should definitely promote is

635
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.960
be very conscious about
anything you share online.

636
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.120
So people tend to share too much
information on social media

637
00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.040
or they're not verifying
some of the details

638
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.040
they've been asked to share
in an email or a text message.

639
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.800
So we just need to be extra vigilant,
careful about what we share online,

640
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.640
because that information, again, could
just be harvested by a criminal.

641
00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.360
And that could even just be someone
who's being very spontaneous,

642
00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:27.720
or it could be a more organised sort
of targeting of certain people.

643
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:33.600
There are also directories online where
you find lots of personal information.

644
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.960
192. com is a directory.

645
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.480
If you're on the electoral roll,

646
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.960
there's a good chance
your details are going to be visible.

647
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.480
And that could include things
like your address, your telephone numbers.

648
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.040
So it's a really good question, I think,

649
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:51.120
just on the theme of scams in general,
good for that awareness to be shared.

650
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.560
I’m just going to check if there's
any other questions that we've had.

651
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.040
Thank you for the ones that have come in,

652
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.400
lots to talk about.

653
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.920
And one of the questions we do have
is do you go to schools

654
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.520
to educate young people
from year seven upwards?

655
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:11.720
So we absolutely do proactively
educate not just our customers,

656
00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.000
but people across local communities

657
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.080
and that's across all of
Barclays touchpoints.

658
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.640
So that could be through a virtual
event like you're seeing today,

659
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.480
that could be students joining
from their classroom,

660
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.480
an event that we deliver virtually.

661
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.120
I'm going to comment on some
resources just very shortly

662
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.120
and I'll pinpoint some of the
content that we have there,

663
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.320
which is available
for all different age groups.

664
00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.000
So certainly lots of proactive
work that we're doing

665
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.520
and I know lots of other
organisations are doing as well.

666
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.720
So with that,

667
00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.920
again, thanks for everybody's
questions that have come in.

668
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:53.680
We're now going to move
onto some useful resources.

669
00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:02.040
So let's just move onto the first resource.

670
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.400
So the first one is the Barclays website.

671
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.560
So if you go to the Barclays website,

672
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:11.400
this includes a fraud and
security hub page,

673
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.240
to really help people stay one
step ahead of the criminals.

674
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.320
Now, within this hub, we have a specific
page all about money mules.

675
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.040
This is the one screenshot
that you can see on screen now.

676
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.560
And this really does provide
some excellent content and guidance.

677
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.760
Everything from what are money mules?

678
00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.280
How can you be approached?

679
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.080
How is social media used?

680
00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.840
What advice do we have for those people
to support young people?

681
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.320
So do visit the Barclays website.

682
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:45.120
You can scan the QR code
that you see on-screen

683
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.400
and you can simply search
for ‘Barclays money mules’

684
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.520
and that will take you to the page,

685
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.960
that's the first listing that you see
in the search results.

686
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.960
So do have a look at the Barclays website.

687
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.720
The next one,

688
00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:02.200
one that the team I work in, I’m
proud to say have been managing

689
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.560
 and creating all the content

690
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.560
for what's called our Barclays
Digital Wings platform.

691
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.160
So this is another great resource
which is completely free

692
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.160
for anyone to use, includes
lots of great content on fraud and scams.

693
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.480
And when you're on the main homepage,

694
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.840
which again you can access
through the QR code,

695
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.360
or by searching Barclays Digital Wings,

696
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.440
you'll see on the top menu
there's an option ‘Online safety’.

697
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.360
If you click on that one,

698
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.240
it takes you to what we call our
‘Staying safe online’ hub page.

699
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.960
This signposts to lots of great
content, lots of tools, resources

700
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:41.720
that you can access to help you
protect yourself in many ways.

701
00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.920
So do have a look at
Barclays Digital Wings.

702
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.760
Click on ‘Online safety’
for more information.

703
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.560
And then just a couple of others,

704
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.480
in terms of further support,

705
00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.400
the first one being Victim Support.

706
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.680
This is a brilliant charity

707
00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.480
that helps victims of crime
providing free, confidential support.

708
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.200
It’s one that Barclays has a
really good relationship with

709
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.840
and why I think this is such a great charity.

710
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.480
When you think about
any scams, any fraud,

711
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.720
the experience that you go through,
it's not just a financial impact on people,

712
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.920
it can be physical,
it can affect your mental health.

713
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.160
So this charity does a huge amount,
offers lots of great services

714
00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.640
to help people who may
have fallen victim to crime.

715
00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:30.840
And this includes the hugely challenging
navigation of the criminal system

716
00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.760
and people understanding their
rights as a victim of crime.

717
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.320
So do have a look at Victim Support.

718
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.800
And the second one is
the ‘Don't Be Fooled’ campaign.

719
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.960
So Don't Be Fooled is a collaboration
between UK finance and Cifas.

720
00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:50.560
It aims to inform students or young people
about the risks of giving out their bank details

721
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.560
and deter them from becoming money mules.

722
00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.200
So lots of great content again.
There’s an excellent short video

723
00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.000
that you can play to young people,
which really highlights the dangers,

724
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.760
the consequences that
you need to think about.

725
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.520
So do have a look at the Don't
Be Fooled websites as well.

726
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.000
Now, as we draw to a close,

727
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.760
I'm now just going to move on
to what we feel

728
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.840
are some really key takeaways
both from Sam and Ebony.

729
00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:23.960
So first of all, we've heard lots from you Sam,

730
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.880
lots of insight, lots of guidance,
lots of work we're doing.

731
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.440
But what would be your key takeaways
for the audience?

732
00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.120
Yeah, thank you Ross.

733
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.000
 So my main takeaways would be that

734
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.360
if you're receiving any money into your account,

735
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.920
make sure that you know
where those funds are coming from.

736
00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.400
And don't be afraid to question

737
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.360
the person who's paying it to you,
even those you trust,

738
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.000
given Ebony's experience,
unfortunately.

739
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.680
A genuine person won't mind
a little bit of questioning.

740
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.800
It's valid in today's environment.

741
00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.640
The second item would be to be really wary

742
00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.680
of urgent requests,
particularly to withdraw funds.

743
00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.160
Just pay to you really at speed.

744
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.320
Mules absolutely need to operate quickly

745
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.600
to move their criminal proceeds
around the financial ecosystem.

746
00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.440
And you'll just be supporting
them if you do that.

747
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.920
So don't make it easy for them,

748
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.720
you know, be very wary of those types of request.

749
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.000
That would be it for me.

750
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:26.920
Thanks Ross.

751
00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.400
Over to you Ebony.

752
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.400
Thanks Sam.

753
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.440
For me, yep, be careful who you trust.

754
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.320
Friends and family could
be recruited by criminals,

755
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:45.720
so be very careful when doing
favours that involve money.

756
00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.760
Always check your account regularly.

757
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.440
Obviously, in my case,
I couldn't check my account regularly

758
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.760
because I did not have access to online
bank or mobile banking.

759
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.160
But nowadays, most of us do

760
00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.080
so please check your accounts regularly,
your bank statements check them regularly

761
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.200
just to see, you know, where
money's coming from.

762
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.040
You might not be expecting
some form of money.

763
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.440
Make sure you contact
your bank immediately

764
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.680
to find out where it came from
before spending it.

765
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:16.600
Because if you withdraw or transfer
any money that comes from

766
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.640
a criminal source, you will be,
you know, punished, like in my case.

767
00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.400
And then the last thing is

768
00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:27.400
do not be fooled by the thought
of making quick money.

769
00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.520
You know, there's a cost of
living crisis right now,

770
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.560
so if you are looking for an extra
income, contact your local jobcentre

771
00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.640
because there are various job
opportunities out there.

772
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.640
Over to you Ross.

773
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.360
Sam, Ebony, thank you for that.

774
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.000
Obviously, lots we've spoke about.

775
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.240
So, I think it’s really important that we just
highlight what are those key takeaways,

776
00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.880
the things that we need to share
with young people.

777
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.240
I think if we just reflect on some of
the things that we've touched on today,

778
00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:00.120
what we do know is historically money
mules used to visit the school gates.

779
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.720
They used to approach
young people in person.

780
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.960
The world has changed.

781
00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.680
The use of technology
means that actually people

782
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.840
people can now sit behind a laptop,
they can sit behind a phone.

783
00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.080
They can do this targeting of
young people in a different way,

784
00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.720
which obviously makes
it even harder to catch these people.

785
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.800
So I think that's something
we really need to bear in mind.

786
00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.120
Young people are exposed to so much online.

787
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.400
Social media has a real
part to play in terms of

788
00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.640
what we see being shared
 in terms of adverts, posts

789
00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.560
but in the meantime, we just
really need to make sure

790
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.960
that young people are aware
of how they can be targeted.

791
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.400
So, I just want to say
a huge thank you

792
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.800
both to our guest speakers
for all of your insight -

793
00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.520
Ebony, the experience you've shared
has been really important

794
00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.680
so thank you so much for joining as well.

795
00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.280
Really encourage you to share the resources

796
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:58.080
with your wider networks,
family and friends, in schools,

797
00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.520
across the education sector,

798
00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.840
to make sure that we
can prevent more people 

799
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.640
not to fall victim.

800
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.320
Such an important topic.

801
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.920
So a ‘big thank you’ for
everybody who's joined.

802
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.760
All of those people who've
registered for today's event,

803
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.120
it's much appreciated.

804
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:18.680
In the near future, there
will be a playback of the event.

805
00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:22.520
So do keep an eye on the Barclays
website on our Barclays channels

806
00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:27.240
for more information to be able to view
the playback and share with other people.

807
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.760
But again, big ‘thank you’
for everybody who’s joined.

808
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:33.440
and we look forward to seeing you
at a future Barclays event.
