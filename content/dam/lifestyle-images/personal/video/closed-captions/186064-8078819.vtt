00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.480
Let's talk loan to value ratio, in 20.

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.200
If you have a £20,000

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.680
deposit on a £200,000 house,

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.480
you're paying 10% of the value,

5
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.520
and need to borrow £180,000.

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.440
Which means your loan to value ratio

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.600
is 90%.

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.200
Lenders like a lower

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.760
loan to value ratio,

10
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.680
and could give you

11
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.920
a better interest rate.

12
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.720
So the bigger your deposit, the better,

13
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.840
which is something worth bearing in mind.
