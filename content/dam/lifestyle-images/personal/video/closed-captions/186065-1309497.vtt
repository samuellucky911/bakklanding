Let's talk workplace pensions, in 20.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.720
So a pension is basically an income

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.800
for your retirement.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.080
The sooner you start one,

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.000
the more comfortable

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.320
you should be in later life.

7
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.120
The good news?

8
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.400
If you're at least 22

9
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.960
and under retirement age,

10
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.880
and earn Â£10,000 or more,

11
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.640
you should already be in a workplace

12
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.480
pension scheme.

13
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480
