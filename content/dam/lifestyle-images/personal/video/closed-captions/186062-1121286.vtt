00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.480
Money stress is incredibly common,
especially at the moment.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.640
It can feel really scary
and all encompassing.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.480
This three step approach just might help.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.680
First, look at any payments
you need to make

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.160
What's in your control and what's not?

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.800
Second, break down
the things that you're in control of.

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.760
Make a plan

8
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.880
Set realistic targets of what you can pay and when.

9
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.400
Finally, look at the things that you feel
are out of your control.

10
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480
If your bills have gone up, mine have

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You might be entitled to some support

12
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.160
If you need help

13
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.480
Reach out to the relevant organisations

14
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.920
Someone you can trust

15
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.560
Or online communities.

16
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.280
You could take a look
at the government's

17
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.880
Help for Households website

18
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.200
To find out what you
might be entitled to.

19
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.360
I really hope having a plan helps.
