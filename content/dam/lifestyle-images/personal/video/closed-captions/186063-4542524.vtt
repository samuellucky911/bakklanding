00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's talk wants versus needs in 20.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.120
So needs are

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.880
the things you really can't go without.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.360
Whereas wants are life's 'nice to haves'.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.160
Then there are things

6
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.560
that seem like needs

7
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.240
but are actually wants.

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.360
Like a meal at home, becoming a meal out.

9
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.280
So, separate what you want from your needs

10
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.160
and make sure your budget reflects it.
