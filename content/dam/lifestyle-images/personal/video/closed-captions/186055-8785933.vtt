1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.760
Instant access savings accounts

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.960
are perfect
for saving smaller amounts.

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.480
Usually you get a lower interest rate,
which can change,

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.680
but you can access it

5
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.360
when you need it.

6
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.480
For instance, if your boiler breaks down.

7
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.200
Fixed access savings accounts

8
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.720
give you a fixed rate,

9
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.480
so you'll know

10
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.200
exactly what you'll get in return.

11
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.720
But withdrawals are restricted.

12
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.600
If you're a Barclays
Blue Rewards customer

13
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.400
you could open a Rainy Day Saver account.

14
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.000
You just need to choose the type that's
right for you and your circumstances.

15
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.120
I hope that helps.
