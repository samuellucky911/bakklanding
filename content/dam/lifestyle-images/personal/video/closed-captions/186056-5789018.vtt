00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.440
Making the minimum payment
is pretty common.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.920
The problem is, the interest starts
to build up.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.920
And the longer you take to pay the card,
the more it could end up costing you.

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.880
If you've got lots of cards, prioritise
the ones with the highest interest.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.560
What can you afford to pay
now and in the longer term?

6
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.800
Now, if you are struggling,
ask your provider for some help.

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.600
Or a charity like Citizens Advice
or the National Debtline.

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.160
I really hope that helps.
