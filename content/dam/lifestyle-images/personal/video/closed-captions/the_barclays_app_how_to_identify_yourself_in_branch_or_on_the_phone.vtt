The Barclays app

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.080
How to identify yourself in
branch or on the phone

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200
It's now really easy to identify
yourself with the Barclays app.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.360
Once we've located your
account information,

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.120
you'll receive notification on your phone.

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.600
Simply tap on the notification
to open the app

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.880
and log in, in the usual way.

8
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.280
You'll then be taken to a screen, asking
you to either confirm the branch you're in,

9
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.160
or the name of the Barclays
agent on the phone.

10
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.520
To confirm your identity,
tap ‘Confirm’.

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.160
Your identity will be verified

12
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.600
and we can carry on helping
you with whatever you need.
