1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Got the shopping.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.200
Come on in, come on in.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.840
Let’s do it.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.680
Obviously, I know I'm cooking
for you and the family today.

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.040
So I thought I’d go
to the High Street

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.640
and get some beautiful, cost effective
ingredients to make a beautiful meal.

7
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.720
They don’t cost too much.

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.520
I appreciate you.

9
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.440
You in the shop thinking
about your family,

10
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.800
How does that work
for you every week?

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.880
We get the kids involved.

12
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.960
They help pick it.

13
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.200
Also it kind of teaches them about
money and the fact that we have to pay.

14
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.080
So what are you going
to make of all this?

15
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.440
I'm gonna make for you
and your amazing family,

16
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.440
a Mexican, one pot
chicken and black bean stew.

17
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.160
It's already got warm in here.
Are you feeling the

18
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.760
salsa vibes?

19
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.360
Let’s do it.

20
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.440
Time effective, cost
effective, flavour effective.

21
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.360
Everything you want from a dish.

22
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.280
Gunna get this chicken in. Skin down.

23
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.480
So obviously right now, things
cost more than they used to.

24
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.320
So what would be your advice for, like,
you know, people in their families

25
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.600
being cost effective
with their money?

26
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.960
What we've done in our house
is look at what are the meals

27
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.280
that we're going to have
and then shop to our meals.

28
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.440
Rather than just buying
what we used to buy before.

29
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.520
And then also, we look at how
can we make them cheaper.

30
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.880
Are there different proteins
that we can use?

31
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.320
Can some of these meals
be over a couple of days?

32
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.680
Yeah but

33
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.720
planning is everything and you'll
save yourself a lot of money.

34
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.840
If you fail to plan,

35
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.560
you plan to fail.

36
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.880
Been doing it for years.

37
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.200
Been doing it for years.

38
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.440
What we have here is
our onions and garlic.

39
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.800
This is going to sweat down
and be the base of our flavor.

40
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.560
When it comes to cooking,

41
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.960
sometimes when I'm outside man,

42
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm in the supermarket and I’m just lost,
I always forget what I have in the yard

43
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.680
and I end up double buying things.

44
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.440
It’s so important to
open the cupboards.

45
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.800
My kids we do a raid.

46
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.400
It's like a game, go through cupboards.

47
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.960
What can you see?

48
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.440
What do we need?

49
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.720
We have a list. Tick it.
So we know what we need.

50
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.320
And so it's a good way to save money.

51
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.840
A good way to make sure
that you're not spending

52
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.560
when you don't need to.

53
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.480
Do you know what I mean?
100%.

54
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.960
We're going to go in with these.

55
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.920
All the juice as well.

56
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.560
Wow.

57
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.480
Give that a stir chef.

58
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.960
Yes chef.

59
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.200
The way you stir, I can
tell you don't do this.

60
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.560
Hold it.

61
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.480
Oh you got to grips it up.

62
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.080
Grips it bro.

63
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.000
Oh grips it.

64
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.160
There we go.

65
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.160
Also the heat comes
from the seeds.

66
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.960
If the seeds ain’t going in there,

67
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.320
you're not going to get all that heat.

68
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.520
Give the beans a little mash.

69
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.800
Just a little one.

70
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.960
Now it’s going to help give us
different textures of the beans.

71
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.120
Is he talking about budgeting?

72
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.280
I've got better at it.

73
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.440
More and more I've learnt to
understand what can I spend this month?

74
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.720
What can I enjoy?

75
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.760
What can I not enjoy?

76
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.880
And what can I put away.

77
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.440
When it comes to the budgeting

78
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.760
what kind of tips can
you give to people then?

79
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.080
A great tip is that your banking app

80
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.680
a lot of these apps
can help you do that.

81
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.040
So it’s not like you have to now
go start learning spreadsheets

82
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.240
and all this type of stuff.

83
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.920
Yeah.

84
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.280
I won’t go get a
degree in economics.

85
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.560
Nah you ain’t gotta be that guy.

86
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.440
Because they got a
breakdown of your spending

87
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.760
and how much money
is spent on food.

88
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.120
How much money is
spent on your bills.

89
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.600
So use that as a reflection of where
you should save your money.

90
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.160
Exactly.

91
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.600
You're like a guru.

92
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.280
I try my best, trying to be like you.

93
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.280
Gunna start making
a little salsa now.

94
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.360
I’m not talking two step.

95
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.440
I’m not talking two step no.

96
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.400
I'm talking a punchy
salsa to go with that.

97
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.400
Look at that fresh little salsa.

98
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.760
With the more simple ingredients.

99
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.920
If you're trying to cook on a budget,
you're trying to make things better,

100
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.440
especially in times like this,

101
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.440
sometimes you got to
go with the own brand.

102
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.720
Get that own brand baked bean.

103
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.880
Get that own brand ketchup.

104
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.960
What do you think about
like the yellow stickers.

105
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.040
It's just as good.

106
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.120
And you're going to save money.

107
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.120
Feel like we could you know.

108
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.920
Dinner ready.

109
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.840
It's time to serve up.

110
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.400
Come on.

111
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.080
My brother.

112
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.960
Here we go man.

113
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.360
Let’s do it.

114
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.760
Love it.

115
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.440
Oh, my goodness.

116
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.080
Mmmm.

117
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.800
Oh.

118
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.360
Little.

119
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.320
I’m alright.

120
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840
My tongue is doing this.

121
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.680
Spicy, punchy.

122
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.640
Fresh,

123
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.640
with all the ingredients.

124
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.080
No waste at all.

125
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.480
Alright,

126
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.960
is it time to feed the fam?

127
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.000
You got me feeling like a chef.

128
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.920
Ready?
Ready.

129
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.000
Let’s do it man. It’s time.

130
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.960
Hold it ready for the flavours boy.

131
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.160
Come on, guys.

132
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.800
Dinner’s ready.

133
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.160
Let's do this.

134
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.000
You’re gonna love it.
