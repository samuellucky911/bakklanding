Let's talk pension types, in 20.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.440
There are three main types of pension

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.080
in the UK.

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.320
These are paid by the government

5
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.920
when you reach retirement age,

6
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.280
based on your national insurance

7
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.000
contributions.

8
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.320
These are set by employers.

9
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.960
When you pay in,

10
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.240
they do too!

11
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.160
A popular choice

12
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.160
when you're self-employed.

13
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.560
You pick the provider,

14
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.040
and where your money is invested.

15
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.720
You can have multiple workplace

16
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.760
and personal pensions,

17
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.720
but you can only have one state pension.
