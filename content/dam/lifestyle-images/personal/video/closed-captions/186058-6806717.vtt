00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.760
Let's talk credit scores, in 20.

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.520
Credit is money

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.840
You need to borrow from a lender.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.680
and your credit score

5
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.760
is a three digit number

6
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.720
that tells lenders

7
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.560
how well you've

8
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.040
repaid credit in the past.

9
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.000
The higher your score,

10
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.720
the better your chances

11
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.080
of you getting a mortgage,

12
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.720
a credit card,

13
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.280
or even a new mobile contract.

14
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.720
Got it?

15
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.760
Score!
