How to add a card to Google Pay

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.120
It's easy to do. Log in and tap
'Cards' from the Quick Links section.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.120
Here you'll see the 'Add to G Pay' button.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.760
To learn more about it, tap here.

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.240
To add the selected card on Google Pay,
tap the 'Add to G Pay' button.

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.440
Read through Barclays terms and conditions
and if you're happy, tap 'Accept'.

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.680
You'll now need to set up a screen lock
on your device if you haven't already.

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.800
You may need to verify your card
with a one-time passcode

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.760
sent to you in a text message.

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.440
When you receive it, enter the passcode,

12
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.640
or for other verification
methods, tap 'More options'.

13
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.880
After verification, your card will be set up.

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.560
And that's all done.

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.520
If you'd like to add the card to
Google Pay on any other devices,

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.600
tap the 'Add to G Pay' button
and follow the same process.
