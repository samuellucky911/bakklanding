00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.520
Let's talk

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.520
agreements in principle

3
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.280
in 20.

4
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.480
Agreements in principle are

5
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.880
something you've probably heard of.

6
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.840
Theyâ€™re the first step

7
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.960
in the mortgage process,

8
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.080
And give you an indication

9
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.680
on how much a bank would be prepared

10
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.320
to lend you.

11
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.480
Based on your income,

12
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.760
spending and debt.

13
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.240
They come with no guarantees,

14
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.960
but they won't affect your credit score,

15
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.000
and they can also help

16
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.080
sellers take your offer more seriously.
