00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.840
Let's talk

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.240
managing regular payments in 20.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.080
So, login to your Barclays app,

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.120
And head to 'regular payments'

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.760
so that you see everything together.

6
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.160
Are there any you can cancel?

7
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.480
You can also think about moving

8
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.480
some payments to just after payday.

9
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.960
It'll give you

10
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.000
a better idea of your money

11
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.960
for the rest of the month

12
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.520
and more control.
