00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.680
Let's talk micro-budgeting.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.520
Budgeting across

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.360
a whole month can be tricky,

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.560
but micro-budgeting can really help.

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600
You can start by covering the essentials,

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.240
like your mortgage,

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.480
your rent and your bills,

8
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.600
then split what's left into micro budgets

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.720
and stick to them.

10
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.840
You can split by purpose,

11
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.120
like meals out or clothes.

12
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.880
I tend to split mine by weeks.

13
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.440
It makes getting to the end of the month

14
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.920
feel more manageable.
