Let's talk Kakeibo Budgeting in twenty.

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.680
Kakeibo is a mindful budgeting technique

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.530
where you write your spending down while

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.149
asking yourself: Why do I need it?

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.040
Can I live without it? Can I afford it? 

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.510
And how do I actually feel about buying it?

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.700
Which helps you really understand your

8
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.860
relationship with money.
