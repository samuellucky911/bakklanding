Firstly, make sure you have
a PINsentry device to hand.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.440
If you don't don't have a physical
PINsentry and are registered for the Barclays app...

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.640
...you can use mobile PINsentry
to authenticate your payments.

7
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.280
On the homepage click on ‘Pay’.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.200
Then select the account you want to make
the payment from in the drop down menu.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.640
Next, click 'Pay someone new'.

10
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.240

a person or a business.

11
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.760
If you're paying a company, click
'Search our verified companies'.

12
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.360
Start to type to search for a business.

16
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.480
...their sort code and their account number.

17
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.120
We'll then check the details
with the recipient's bank.

the payment now or at a later date.

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.840
Add a payment reference that you'll
both see on your account.

22
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.920
Choose the ‘Payment purpose’.

23
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.000
Then, if you've read the information about

24
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160

Then type your card PIN and press 'ENTER'.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.000
Enter the 8-digit challenge number displayed on
your computer screen here....

32
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.840
...into your PINsentry device and press 'ENTER'.

33
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.720
You'll then receive an 8-digit code

34
