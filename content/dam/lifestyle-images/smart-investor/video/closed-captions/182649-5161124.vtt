At Barclays, we understand that when it comes
to investing, often the hardest part is knowing

2
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.520
where to start. That’s why we offer five
Ready-made Investment funds to help you take

3
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.740
that first step. They offer a convenient one-stop
solution which can be ideal if you’re not

4
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.630
sure about making your own investment decisions,
or are short on time.

5
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.020
These funds take the work out of investing
because they’re looked after by Barclays’

6
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.090
investment experts who do all of the
hard stuff so you don't have to. They’ll

7
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.890
make changes to where your money’s invested
depending on what’s going on in the stock

8
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.520
markets, and keep you regularly updated with how
your investment's performing. It’s worth

9
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.300
mentioning though, that you can check how your
investment's doing at any time either online or via

10
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.010
the Barclays app.

11
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.440
There’s always risk involved
with investing because obviously stock markets can fall

12
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.260
as well as rise, so there’s a chance you
could lose money. However, there are ways to reduce

13
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.450
that risk and this is how the funds
differ. They all invest in a mixture of shares,

14
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.830
bonds and cash, which gives you instant diversification
which is really important when it comes to investing

15
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.876
because it can help protect against stock market
falls, but the proportion they hold in each differs.

16
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.110
So to get started all you need to do is choose
which fund to go for. Whether you’re more

17
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.440
comfortable taking a lower risk approach or are
happy to take a bit more risk in the hope of potentially

18
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.050
higher returns, hopefully there'll be a fund
to match your needs.

19
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.789
I hope you found that helpful – but there is a lot more
information about Ready-made Investments on our website.
