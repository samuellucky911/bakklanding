00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.520
If you have money left at the end of the month, 
you may be wondering whether you should save or  

2
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.380
invest it. In a perfect world, you'll have both 
savings and investments because each have a  

3
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.180
different yet equally important role to play when 
it comes to helping you improve your finances.

4
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.580
Your savings are there so you have money you 
can access in case something unexpected happens,  

5
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.620
like the boiler breaking down, and also for 
short-term financial goals, those in the next  

6
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.320
few years such as holidays, house deposit, or a 
wedding. Investments on the other hand help with  

7
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.240
your long-term financial security because stock 
markets tend to produce better returns than cash  

8
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.580
over time, so investing provides the potential 
to increase your wealth by more than if you just  

9
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.460
leave it all in savings. There is additional risk 
involved though because stock markets fluctuate,  

10
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.840
which is why it's important not to invest 
all your money and have some savings as  

11
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.200
well. If you're only investing for a 
year or two and the stock market falls,  

12
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.420
you've got less time for it to recover, so there's 
a high chance you could lose money. However,  

13
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.320
this is less likely to happen the 
longer you keep your money invested.

14
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.320
So how much money do you need in savings before 
you're ready to invest? Some suggest three months’  

15
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.420
salary, others advise more, and there's no right 
or wrong here because it all depends on you and  

16
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.120
your circumstances. To work out the right amount 
for you, consider things such as how much you need  

17
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.560
to cover essential bills each month in case 
you're unable to work for any reason. Also,  

18
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.760
if you were to lose your job, how long do you 
think it would take to find a new one? And is  

19
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.800
yours the only salary coming into the household 
or is there another one to fall back on? For one  

20
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.060
person, three months’ salary might be enough; but 
for somebody else they might feel they need more.  

21
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.640
But one of the big problems here in the UK 
is that even when people do have savings,  

22
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.720
many don't go on to invest and this 
is putting their future financial  

23
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.460
security at risk because they face not having 
enough money to last them through retirement.  

24
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.880
There's lots of research about why this is and 
two of the main barriers that have been identified  

25
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.160
that people are scared of investing because of the 
risk and because they think it's too complicated.  

26
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.860
Yes, there are risks, but there 
are also great potential rewards.  

27
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.260
And there are steps you can take to reduce the 
risk and reduce the chance of losing money. Now,  

28
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.180
I've already talked about the importance of time 
here. But another key thing is diversification.  

29
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.520
You can spread the risk by holding a broad 
range of investments. After all no single  

30
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.660
investment will be the top performer all 
of the time and in all economic conditions.

31
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.300
So by holding a good spread the hope is that if 
one part of your portfolio isn't doing so well,  

32
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.500
you'll have other investments that are 
faring better offsetting any losses.  

33
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.140
Many people also worry that investing is 
complicated and not suitable for them. But  

34
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.280
once they look into it in more detail and 
get started, they often realise it's not  

35
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.620
as complex as it can first appear and there 
are plenty of resources to help. At Barclays,  

36
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.300
we produce lots of content: articles, videos, 
and podcasts that are all free and available  

37
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.000
to anyone. We also have a research centre to 
help customers with their investment decisions.  

38
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.980
Complexity and risks aren't the only things 
that can put people off investing though.

39
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.820
The fact we talk about it being something to 
help you in the future rather than the near  

40
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.340
term also means that other things can feel more 
important, which is totally understandable.  

41
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.320
But the sooner you start, the more likely 
you are to achieve your longer-term goals  

42
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.600
and the easier it will be because you won't 
have to invest as much each month. Finally,  

43
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.580
whether you're at the stage of building up your 
savings or are in a position to invest too,  

44
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.120
putting away money monthly is a great habit to get 
into and it will help you reach your goals sooner.
