Hello, I am Clare, Savings
and Investments Director

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.013
at Smart Investor.

3
00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:11.880
I am going to talk to you
about ISA flexibility.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.580
Please be aware though, we can not offer

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.470
personal advice so if
you do not feel confident

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.000
about making an investment
decision on your own,

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.340
do seek independent financial advice.

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.760
ISAs have been made more flexible

9
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.840
for savers and investors
over recent years.

10
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.570
For example, you can now
withdraw money from an ISA

11
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.590
and return it in the same tax year,

12
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.460
without this counting towards
that year's ISA allowance,

13
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.650
which is currently £20,000.

14
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.570
Let's say, for example,
you had already put £15,000

15
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.560
of your £20,000
allowance into an ISA,

16
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.700
but take £5,000 out.

17
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.380
You could pay that back
in plus the £5,000

18
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.070
you have not already used
before the end of the tax year.

19
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.970
At Barclays we offer a flexible ISA,

20
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.610
but not all providers
do, and some may only

21
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.200
apply it to specific products
so it is worth checking

22
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.370
before you open an account if you think

23
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.460
it is a feature you might make use of.

24
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.040
We have got lots more videos
about ISAs and investing

25
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.980
on our website, so take
a look and find out

26
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.644
more about how the rules work.
