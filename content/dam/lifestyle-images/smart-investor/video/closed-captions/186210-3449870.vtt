00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.200
One of the most common things new investors wonder about when it 
comes to getting started, is whether or not it’s a good time.

2
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.840
As the saying goes – there’s 
no time like the present.

3
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.680
Stock markets don’t move in a straight line 
and without the help of a crystal ball,  

4
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.120
there’s no way of choosing the best day to 
invest your money. Even the professionals  

5
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.040
don’t have the answer. What’s important is 
whether it’s the right time for you to invest,  

6
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.700
rather than worrying about what’s 
happening in the wider economy.

7
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.560
And the right time will be different 
for everybody. But as a rule of thumb,  

8
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.580
if you don’t have credit cards debts or 
loans and you’ve got rainy-day savings to  

9
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.320
cover unexpected costs, and short-term goals 
– like holidays – and then you’ve got some money  

10
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.540
you can afford to put away for a few years 
– we suggest at least five – investing is  

11
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.820
worth considering. Because the sooner you 
start, the longer your money has to grow.

12
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.860
Naturally, there will be ups and downs along the 
way and sometimes the value of your investments 

13
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.180
will fall. But this only matters if you 
want to sell your investments – otherwise,  

14
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.840
it’s just a loss on paper. And 
even if you do need to sell,  

15
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100
you will only lose money if the value 
is lower than the amount you’d invested.

16
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.000
If you’ve been investing for a while and 
the value has gone up before it's fallen,  

17
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.280
you might still get back more than you’d put in.

18
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.100
Also, try and avoid knee-jerk reactions 
if stock markets start to fall. Some of  

19
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.880
the worst performing days have been 
followed by some of the best. So if  

20
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.840
you panic and sell because share prices 
have fallen, you risk missing out on the  

21
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.160
recovery. It’s time in the market that 
matters, and not timing the market.

22
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.800
Historically, over the long-term stock markets 
tend to produce better returns than cash,  

23
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.020
though there are of course no guarantees .

24
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.220
By keeping your money invested and 
riding out difficult market cycles,  

25
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.620
it should have time to recover from any 
market downturns so you reap the longer-term benefits.

26
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.660
