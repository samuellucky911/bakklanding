00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.420
Many people are put off from investing because they think 
it’s too risky. But we take risks every  

2
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.320
day in life and often make conscious 
decisions about what we do and don’t do,  

3
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.280
depending on the chance of something going 
wrong or the potential reward we’ll get.

4
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.900
So rather than just ruling investing out 
because you think you might lose money,  

5
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.400
it’s worth taking some time to 
understand how likely that is and  

6
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.340
what you can do to take a level 
of risk you’re comfortable with.

7
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.500
There’s no getting away from the fact that 
you could lose money if you invest because  

8
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.520
stock markets fall as well as rise, but 
there are things you can do to reduce  

9
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.860
the chance of this happening. And if you’re 
not too worried about risk and stock market movements  

10
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.760
you might be happy to take quite a lot of 
risk in the hope you’ll get better returns.

11
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.480
The key is investing in a way 
that you’re comfortable with.  

12
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.120
So what are the main things to bear in mind?

13
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.140
Firstly, remember when it comes to 
where you keep your hard-earned money,  

14
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.038
there’s no escaping a degree of risk. Even 
keeping it all in a cash savings account  

15
00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:17.160
isn’t risk-free. You won’t actually 
lose money, but its spending power can  

16
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.420
fall over time if the rate of inflation is 
higher than the rate of interest you earn.

17
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.540
Secondly, whatever level of 
risk you’re comfortable with,  

18
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.260
a diversified portfolio is 
what you should be aiming for.

19
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.460
If you only buy shares in a single 
company – which is what many people do,  

20
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.660
especially when they’re starting out –
your returns are entirely dependent on  

21
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.400
the successes of that one company, which 
makes it a high-risk strategy to take.

22
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.580
A lower-risk approach is to invest in funds. 
With a fund your money is pooled with that of  

23
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.980
other investors and then invested in a number of 
different companies, giving you that all-important  

24
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.980
diversification. This doesn’t totally eradicate 
risk – but the diversification helps to spread it.

25
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.020
You can create a balanced, diversified 
portfolio by putting your money into funds  

26
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.460
that invest in different types of companies 
and different areas of the world. That way  

27
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.760
they’ll all perform differently, so if 
some of your investments are struggling,  

28
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.460
you’ll hopefully have others that are doing well.

29
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.200
You don’t need to pick a large number of 
funds at the outset – you can build your  

30
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.240
portfolio of investments over time. One year 
you might choose a UK fund where your money  

31
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.520
is invested in a collection of UK companies. 
The year after you might go for a European fund,  

32
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.160
US fund, a global fund, or one that invests 
in Emerging Markets and so on. You can also  

33
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.380
invest in funds which focus on specialised 
sectors, such as technology or healthcare.

34
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.920
Once you’re ready to look at investment options,  

35
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.200
we offer different ways to invest which allow 
you to be as hands-on or as hands-off as you like.

36
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.020
Barclays Ready-made Investments (RMI) is a range  

37
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.740
of diversified funds that invest in 
different types of assets – shares,  

38
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.440
bonds, and cash – and different regions. All 
you need to do is select the level of risk  

39
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.060
you are most comfortable with. If you’re new 
to investing, these funds can be great as they  

40
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.220
offer a simple way of getting started and 
provide you with immediate diversification.

41
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.620
They’re not only for first-timers though – 
Ready-made Investments are also useful if you’re  

42
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.780
short on time or would prefer to leave the 
task of selecting funds to the professionals.

43
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.000
If you prefer to select own investments though, 
the Barclays Funds List is a great option.  

44
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.960
Our list is made up of several funds 
from each of the investment sectors we  

45
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.280
believe are key for building a diversified 
portfolio. There’s plenty of information  

46
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.660
on each fund and its objectives – 
what it is and what it aims to do.

47
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.580
So, whether you want to do it yourself or leave 
it to the experts, there’s hopefully a solution  

48
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.340
to suit you. The key is to decide how much 
risk you’re comfortable with before you start.
